Rails has it&amp;#39;s own wild way of dealing with javascript, so lets go through how to make them play well together. Install tailwindcss Inside of your rails project, install tailwind: yarn add tailwindcss Then we create a directory app/javascript/stylesheets that we will have tailwind use.</description></item><item><title>Rails in Docker</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/rails_in_docker/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/rails_in_docker/</guid><description>In leveraging disposability for exploration we looked at how to build software without having it installed on your local computer. Lets go through how to setup and develop a rails application with this process. docker-compose.yml all the way down We&amp;#39;re going to create our app by adding things to a docker-compose.yml file as needed. Lets create the first one, which will contain our rails container as well as a volume for keeping track of all the gems.</description></item><item><title>Release code diffs</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/release_code_diffs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/release_code_diffs/</guid><description>When tracking and upgrading software you want to have an idea of what changed. Looking at the readme is helpful, and projects that keep a changelog are polite and friendly, but it&amp;#39;s nice to actually get down to it and see what the changes actually are. Loading the repo and finding the tags We first need to look at where the code is from. In looking at gemfiles we found how to see what gem you are currently working with, and in looking and package.</description></item><item><title>Looking at package.json</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/looking_at_packagejson/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/looking_at_packagejson/</guid><description>Look at the dependencies First lets create a simple project and add a single module, in this case npm-api which will we use to access the main repository. npm init -y npm add npm-api And lets see what&amp;#39;s been installed in node_modules: ls -l node_modules | wc -l du -sh node_modules 68 12M node_modules 68 directories with 12M of code!</description></item><item><title>Looking at Gemfiles</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/looking_at_gemfiles/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/looking_at_gemfiles/</guid><description>Bundler is the standard way for Ruby projects to specifiy dependencies. Let&amp;#39;s take a look at how that works, reimplement bundle outdated, and be able to see the changes that took place between the build you are using and the latest one. Ruby ecosystem: Rubygems, Bundler, Gemfile, Gemfile.lock rubygems is the overall ecosystem, which includes the main rubygems.org database of shared packages, and how they depend upon each other.</description></item><item><title>gitlog in sqlite</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/gitlog_in_sqlite/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/gitlog_in_sqlite/</guid><description>askgit is a great way to look at information inside of a repository. However it currently doesn&amp;#39;t support looking at the files inside of the commit itself – it gives you a view of the repository at the time of the commit, but not the patch itself. Since I don&amp;#39;t know enough about golang and sqlite virtual tables, let&amp;#39;s just create a sqlite3 database from the logfile. Get the gitlog We are going to use our favorite test repo, ruby-git because it&amp;#39;s so deliciously meta.</description></item><item><title>Using Askgit</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/using_askgit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/using_askgit/</guid><description>askgit provides a sql interface to your git repository. Let&amp;#39;s install it and see what we can figure out about the repo. Installing Following the instructions on the website, we can build the go binary with: go get -v -tags=sqlite_vtable github.com/augmentable-dev/askgit This will download the package, the dependencies, and compile everything into an executable. If you can&amp;#39;t figure out where it&amp;#39;s installed, check that you have GOPATH set correctly, and it will end up in $GOPATH/bin.</description></item><item><title>Getting Websters</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/getting_websters/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/getting_websters/</guid><description>A few years ago I read a great post about the value of a good dictionary, which I installed on my laptop and then promptly forgot about. The post is very moving, and I recommend checking it out. It was recently mentioned on the planet emacs blog circuit and so I thought I&amp;#39;d document how to get it up and running on my laptop. Also I don&amp;#39;t understand what the appeal of John McPhee&amp;#39;s writing, I&amp;#39;ve tried a few of his books but found them all so plodding.</description></item><item><title>Setting up SSB-Pub Server</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/setting_up_ssb_pub_server/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/setting_up_ssb_pub_server/</guid><description>I wanted to move my ssb installation over to a new computer, and the easiest way was to setup a pub server, invite the old and the new computer to the pub, and then swap out the keys. Here&amp;#39;s how to do it. Overview Create a server &amp;amp; name Install docker Create the docker image Setup directories, config, and easy shell commands Start up a container Publish yourself as a pub Connect your client Create a server I&amp;#39;m using debian 10 on digital ocean, but I&amp;#39;ll let you get the system on the internet.</description></item><item><title>Effigy, a distributed social data layer</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/effigy_social_data_layer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/effigy_social_data_layer/</guid><description>I grew up in the world of BBSes, Usenet, and, to some extent, UUCP before that. This was fun – a world wide network all built up by volunteers sharing. Since we are all carrying supercomputers around now with massive idle storage and bandwidth, let&amp;#39;s think about how we can recreate some of that fun, independent data sharing with modern web technologies, specifically Websockets and WebRTC. All you need is the computer that you already have with you.</description></item><item><title>Upgrading emacs on debian</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/upgrading_emacs_on_debian/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/upgrading_emacs_on_debian/</guid><description>Been playing with elfeed on Emacs 26.1 on buster and it keeps crashing. I think for font related reasons. So lets follow the Emacs Wiki Instructions to upgrade to emacs-snapshots and see if that helps. Add the snap shot repository. Make sure you have the tools installed so that apt can do it&amp;#39;s internet thing. sudo apt-get install software-properties-common sudo apt-get update Add the signing key: wget -q http://emacs.</description></item><item><title>Checking health of RSS feeds</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/checking_rss_health/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/checking_rss_health/</guid><description>I still use RSS feeds as my main way of consuming stuff on the internet. Old school. I was looking at the list of things that I&amp;#39;ve subscribed to which has been imported back from the Google Reader days, and figured I&amp;#39;d do some exploration of ye old OPML file. Setup the Gemfile We&amp;#39;ll need to pull in a few gems here: source &amp;#39;https://rubygems.org&amp;#39; gem &amp;#39;httparty&amp;#39; # To pull stuff from the network gem &amp;#39;feedjira&amp;#39; # To parse RSS feeds gem &amp;#39;nokogiri&amp;#39; # To parse XML gem &amp;#39;domainator&amp;#39; # To figured out the domain from the hostname gem &amp;#39;whois&amp;#39; # To see how old the domain is gem &amp;#39;whois-parser&amp;#39; # To actually make sense of the result And install everything bundle Look at domains First, lets see what we can find out about the machine that hosts the feed.</description></item><item><title>Using Syncthing</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/using_syncthing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/using_syncthing/</guid><description>Syncthing is a way to keep things up-to-date across machines without going through any 3rd party servers. You get both backup and file synchronization without pesky servers just using the computer capacity you probably already have laying around. Lets give it a spin.

We sure can! Lets walk through the process.
First make sure that docker is installed. This is handy if you are working on a remote server for example.
Bootstrap Then lets start building out the Dockerfile that we will use.
mkdir testapp cd testapp Create a Dockerfile.initial that has node:14 in it.

Running npx live-server is an easy one liner to spin up a server, that opens a browser for you and also updates changes on safe. Sometimes that&amp;#39;s not enough. Often you want to pull in data from an API, and that requires HTTPS, and also you need to work around CORS limitations.</description></item><item><title>Beginning Emacs</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/beginning_emacs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/beginning_emacs/</guid><description>Intro I&amp;#39;ve been dipping back ito the world of free software, and have been having a huge amount of fun getting back into emacs. I&amp;#39;m using it more of an operating system than I ever did before, as a way to navigate the world using a text interface. I&amp;#39;d never thought I&amp;#39;d be done with the terminal, but this is the first time that I&amp;#39;ve got something better and more powerful.</description></item><item><title>IPFS and Fuse</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/ipfs_and_fuse/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/ipfs_and_fuse/</guid><description>IPFS is cool. It&amp;rsquo;s a peer to peer distributed file system, or graph database, where you reference the data by its hash. This has the great property that the data is no longer tied to a particular computer or server. It can be spread around and you can get it from anybody without worrying if they&amp;rsquo;ve changed or alterted it in any way. If you know what you are looking for, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about who you get it from.</description></item><item><title>Playing with deno</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/deno/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/deno/</guid><description>Deno is a new V8 based TypeScript and JavaScript programming language that works like a command line web browser. It was written by the creaters of NodeJS and seeks to fix some of the issues with Node around it&amp;rsquo;s security model and pacakge management. Lets look at building a simple webservice using redis.
Install deno If you are in OSX you can use homebrew or install from a shell installer:</description></item><item><title>Book Image Shortcode for Hugo</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/book_images_shortcode/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/book_images_shortcode/</guid><description>HappyFunCorp helped build Bookshop.org which is an online bookstore that distributes 30% of the book profits to independent bookstores in your area. Basically it&amp;rsquo;s a place that people can link to that isn&amp;rsquo;t Amazon, and that will kick some money to your local community.
I wanted to find a way to easily create links to these product pages, and show images if needed. There&amp;rsquo;s no API to access bookshop (I asked on our internal dev channel) but I know how to write a script so I cobbled something together and made a hugo shortcode to render stuff on my blog.</description></item><item><title>Styling tables with Hugo</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/styling_tables_with_hugo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/styling_tables_with_hugo/</guid><description>Markdown is a nice format to write it, but sometimes you need to add HTML classes directly to the output to make it look how you want. Here&amp;rsquo;s a way to do that using hugo shortcodes.
Create a table shortcode Put this in /layouts/shortcodes/table.html:
{{ $htmlTable := .Inner | markdownify }} {{ $class := .Get 0 }} {{ $old := &amp;#34;&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&amp;#34; }} {{ $new := printf &amp;#34;&amp;lt;table class=\&amp;#34;%s\&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;#34; $class }} {{ $htmlTable := replace $htmlTable $old $new }} {{ $htmlTable | safeHTML }} Create a table Like this:</description></item><item><title>Emacs Tramp tricks</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/tramp_tricks/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/tramp_tricks/</guid><description>Emacs is amazing. It&amp;rsquo;s a very different sort of thing than a code text editor like Vim or an IDE like VSCode. It&amp;rsquo;s a different way of thinking of how to interact with a computer, where you build up techniques on top of simple tricks that let you get amazing things done. Of course, part of the appeal/challenge is that you need to figure out how to make it work yourself.</description></item><item><title>Making charts with VueJS and no tooling</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/making_charts_with_vuejs_and_no_tooling/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/making_charts_with_vuejs_and_no_tooling/</guid><description>I learned most of what I know about coding by looking at source code &amp;ndash; especially view source on a web browser. Lets see if we can bring that era back a bit by using ES modules and eschewing webpack and other bundling systems. We will use the amazing unpkg.com CDN to get our building blocks to assemble together.
First get vue working From unpkg we will link to tailwindcss in the head tag, and then import vuejs from using a script type=&amp;quot;module&amp;quot; tag.</description></item><item><title>Leveraging disposability for exploration</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/leveraging_disposability_for_exploration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/leveraging_disposability_for_exploration/</guid><description>I play around with a lot of technology to see what&amp;rsquo;s out there and keep myself current, especially trying to find simpler ways to do our work. One of the issues is that this can leave lots of stuff laying which can be messy. Here are some techniques I use to keep things under control.
There are two complementary principle&amp;rsquo;s that I focus on. One is reproducibility, and the other is disposibility.</description></item><item><title>Playing with tailwind</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/playing_with_tailwind/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/playing_with_tailwind/</guid><description>We are going to use tailwindcss to build a site. We will start with a blank folder and a static HTML file to work on the designs, and then slowly bring in other tools when needed to add in functionality.
The site that we are going to build is a company directory that pulls in data from Google Apps Suite. The goal here is to build the simplest thing possible and not get lost in the tooling.</description></item><item><title>Styling Hugo Diffs</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/styling_hugo_diffs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/styling_hugo_diffs/</guid><description>I often want to show small changes I&amp;rsquo;m making to a file and it would be nice for hugo to support styling patches directly. Lets see what we can do to make this process easier.
Lets take the example of create node package.json file and add the following scripts worflow. How can we say this different than &amp;ldquo;copy this into your package.json file&amp;rdquo;?
Create sample steps Lets first create the file using npm init -y and then immediately cp package.</description></item><item><title>Template to setup a linode server with DNS and HTTPS</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/server_templating_with_terraform/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/server_templating_with_terraform/</guid><description>I use DNSimple for domain management, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with a bunch of different cloud providers and deployment setups. So I wanted to make it easier to give these machines names rather than clicking through the control panel all the time. Lets walk through how to use terraform, DNSimple, and linode to provision and new machine and give it a name on the internet, and then create a webserver on it to which encrypts traffic.</description></item><item><title>Terraform and Packer with Digital Ocean</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/terraform_with_digitalocean/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/terraform_with_digitalocean/</guid><description>Terraform orchastrates the setting up of your infrastructure, and packer helps you build images. We are going to setup terraform to work with Digital Ocean, and then use package to create and image and deploy it.

There&amp;rsquo;s no obvious way to export this from the application, and they don&amp;rsquo;t have a published interface. Lets look at hope to use chrome developer tools to figure out what the API is.
We know that PocketCasts must have an API since it also has a mobile app &amp;ndash; the code in the mobile app must talk to the code in the server using a format that computers understand, which is basically the definition of an API.</description></item><item><title>Controlling IKEA Tradfri devices from your computer</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/controlling_ikea_tradfri_with_node/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/controlling_ikea_tradfri_with_node/</guid><description>&lt;p>I stumbled upon a &lt;a href="https://vas3k.com/blog/dumbass_home/?ref=sn">fun blogpost about the Dumbass Home&lt;/a> and it turned me onto the IKEA Trådfri line of products.

Building off of our foundational article here are a few other things that I found very useful when using middleman to build a static site with a bunch of dynamically generated content.
Partials The index.html.haml, articles.html.haml, tag.html.haml and calendar.html.haml pages all use the same partial to list out the post archives, which are mostly the same.</description></item><item><title>Dateslice: Writing rails extensions</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/dateslice-writing-rails-extensions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/dateslice-writing-rails-extensions/</guid><description>Ruby on Rails is a very modular framework since the merging with Merb in 2008. The opinionated conventions are implemented under using techniques that let you jump in and build your own components, picking and choosing different parts that let you build Rails apps in the same straightforward way you would if using the official modules.
Let&amp;rsquo;s go through the dateslices gem which I wrote to extend active record so that we could better interact with the group by sql command when dealing with dates.</description></item><item><title>Pulling data out of Google Analytics</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/pulling-data-out-of-google-analytics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/pulling-data-out-of-google-analytics/</guid><description>I like staring at the real time stats of Google Analytics. As a dashboard, it&amp;rsquo;s not really as amazing as Chartbeat is, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t let you drill down into the data as much as Mixpanel. But GA is super simple to setup and it&amp;rsquo;s Google, so everyone uses it.
Another obsessive/fun thing to do is to see where that spike in inbound traffic is coming from. On HappyFunCorp there are days where we get a sudden influx of Happy Thoughts which warms our hearts and floods our inboxes.</description></item><item><title>New HappySeed released</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/new-happyseed-released/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/new-happyseed-released/</guid><description>Make apps faster Head on over to the HappySeed website to get the latest version of HappyFunCorp&amp;rsquo;s starter application toolkit.

The most useful things I use are:
layouts and partials so I only need to set things up once haml for writing html, since I don&amp;rsquo;t like closing tags Bootstrap and sass for writing css Markdown for formatting large blogs of content coffeescript for JavaScript Middleman is a static site generator, which means that it takes a bunch of source files, does some stuff with it, and produces static HTML, CSS, Images, and Javascript that can be hosted on a basic server somewhere, including hosting on S3 or Github Pages so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to consider a server.</description></item><item><title>Scripting Twitter: Collecting Data and Writing Bots</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/scripting-twitter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/scripting-twitter/</guid><description>Lets build on our command line url exploring tool to look at how we can interact with Twitter. We are going to cover how to make a script that will pull information out of twitter, how to deal with its rate limiting, and how to interact with users on Twitter itself.
Twitter uses OAuth 1.0A as a way to authenticate requests. As a script writer, this is super annoying, because you can&amp;rsquo;t just stick a username and password in the environment and go from there.</description></item><item><title>Embedding 3d models on your page</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/embedding-3d-models-on-your-page/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/embedding-3d-models-on-your-page/</guid><description>Github has an embeddable 3d model viewer that you can use to display a model on your site. The model needs to be hosted in a github repo, and the format is
&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;https://embed.github.com/view/3d/&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;repo&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;path_to_file&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
Here&amp;rsquo;s a model of me that we made using the Structure 3d scanner which is a fun device that plugs into your iPhone or iPad.
Pretty fun right?
The next thing you need to do is to get a 3d printer, so you can create action figures for your office.</description></item><item><title>Personal information from only a URL</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/personal-information-from-only-a-url/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/personal-information-from-only-a-url/</guid><description>Ever wonder what you can find out by looking at a url?

The anxiety of Y2K rose and crested, and the messianic aura of agents was washed away by more centralized and effective solutions.
The aspirational residue did yield some nuggets, and the idea has found partial success in the form of the bot.</description></item><item><title>Making a command line utility with gems and thor</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/making-a-command-line-utility-with-gems-and-thor/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/making-a-command-line-utility-with-gems-and-thor/</guid><description>Some scripts work well because they are self contained and don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of dependancies, like the hosts on your network tracker.
Others scripts

When it first boots up, it is it&amp;rsquo;s old fast self, but after a few hours everything slows down. Remember the days when you needed to restart your computer to keep it working well? I had forgotten, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really into remembering it.
I also upgraded to Airmail 2. I get a ton of email and it used it be a lot faster than using Mail.</description></item><item><title>Field of Dreams is 25 years old and hasn't aged well</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/field-of-dreams-is-25-years-old-and-hasn-t-aged-well/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/field-of-dreams-is-25-years-old-and-hasn-t-aged-well/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure you all remember the movie. A man whose normal life is starting to fall apart. He&amp;rsquo;s got the wife, family, mortgage and it&amp;rsquo;s both not enough and slipping away. He needs to do something, something to make him feel alive. And since it was that era of Hollywood film making, he&amp;rsquo;s also got plenty of daddy issues he&amp;rsquo;s working through. He becomes seized by a vision, caught in the grip of an idée fixe that he needs to go build something that everyone around him thinks is preposterous.</description></item><item><title>Bootstrap: Advanced Grid Tricks</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/bootstrap-advanced-grid-tricks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/bootstrap-advanced-grid-tricks/</guid><description>We are a big fan of Bootstrap here at HappyFunCorp. While there are some arguments to be made if Bootstrap in particular is all that, or if Foundation is better for a given thing, its clear that starting with some sort of CSS framework is smarter than trying to roll everything yourself. [1]
There are three major complaints with using bootstrap.
All of the sites look the same. There are so many classes in the HTML where they don&amp;rsquo;t strictly belong It&amp;rsquo;s a whole bunch of stuff that you don&amp;rsquo;t need.</description></item><item><title>How to track your coworkers</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/how-to-track-your-coworkers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/how-to-track-your-coworkers/</guid><description>How much information do you bleed?
Ever wonder who is else is using your network? Or,who has actually showed up at the office?
Networking primer The simplest thing we can do to make this work is to check to see which devices have registered themselves on the network. As devices come and go, they connect automatically, so we will have a pretty good idea if people are there or not. Phones seem to attach and detach quite frequency, probably to conserve battery, so if we are want to answer the question &amp;ldquo;is so-and-so in the office&amp;rdquo; we&amp;rsquo;ll need to add additional logic to determine how far spaced the &amp;ldquo;sighting&amp;rdquo; events are to mean that the person has left the office, rather than the phone has gone to sleep.</description></item></channel></rss>
