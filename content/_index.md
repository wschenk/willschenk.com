I am a father, entrepreneur, technologist and aspiring woodsman.

I live in [the woods of Northwest Connecticut](https://cornwallct.org/) where our four boys run around outside. I live with [Ksenia](https://twitter.com/Kseniase_). We also have 2 dogs, (old man) Happy and (puppy) Pheonix. I have a lumber mill and all the kids love using the tractor.

I cofounded [HappyFunCorp](https://happyfuncorp.com) in Sept 2009, but left when my wife died of a brain hemmorage in Janurary of 2022. We sold the company later that year in November.
