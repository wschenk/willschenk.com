# Will Schenk

This is my little corner of the internet. I use it to document things that I'm working on and as a place to keep track of different things.

After 20 years in NYC, we bought a house [northwest Connecticut](https://cornwallct.org/) in the beginning of 2020. We came up for a long weekend, and now we live here.

My wife suddenly passed away from a brain hemmorage in Janurary 2022. Our children were 3, 5, and 7 at the time. I pulled back from [HappyFunCorp](https://happyfuncorp.com), and we sold it in November of 2022. My partner Ben Schippers and I founded the company in 2011.

Now I work on:

- [Tezlab](https://tezlabapp.com) a companion app for Tesla owners.
- [GitGratitude](https://gitgratitude.com) giving back to the open source community
- [Cornwall Market](https://cornwallmarket.com) a local grocery store and chocolate emporium
- [Fine and Fair Food](http://fineandfairfoods.com/) we are a climate-forward and decolonial chocolate and natural ingredients company. Our mission is to properly reward the stewards of Earth's most fragile
