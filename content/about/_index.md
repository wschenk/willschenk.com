I am a father, entrepreneur, technologist and aspiring woodsman.

My wife [Ksenia](https://twitter.com/Kseniase_) and I live in [the
woods of Northwest Connecticut](https://cornwallct.org/) with our four
boys and one baby girl run around outside. We also have 2 dogs, (old
man) Happy and (puppy) Pheonix. I have a lumber mill and all the kids
love using the tractor.

I cofounded [HappyFunCorp](https://happyfuncorp.com) in Sept 2009, but
left when my late-wife Joy [died of a brain
hemmorage](/fragments/2023/a_good_death/)  in
Janurary of 2022. We sold the company later that year in November.
