I stumbled upon [The Practicality of Art in Software](https://www.macstories.net/stories/the-practicality-of-art-in-software/), which links to a couple of Daring Fireballs' posts,
[meanwhile over in Androidtown](https://daringfireball.net/2023/01/meanwhile_over_in_androidtown) and [making our Heart Sing](https://daringfireball.net/2023/02/making_our_hearts_sing).  And I had this sort of moment, what?  Sometimes I have these moments when I'm not sure if I'm crazy or the whole world is crazy.

The gist of these posts is that iOS apps prioritize craftsmanship and emotional appeal, Android apps seem to focus more on comprehensive feature checklists.  Thus we have a moment of virtual signal that the inhabitants of Appletown are are in tune with their poetic sensibilities, while the inhabitants of Androidtown are, to paraquote Wilde, all "the cost of everything and the value of nothing".

In other words, over here we are living out of our cars or at best in mobile homes, while over there it's all #vanlife and tiny-houses.

It's just so wild!  How could you even think those thoughts?

## Quickback ground on me

Just so we are clear, I live on a 20 acre plot of land in Connecticut.  I own two Teslas, and owned a [product engineering company](https://happyfuncorp.com) where we've designed a built over 200 mobile apps, both iOS and Android.  I owned the original iPhone and used probably 5 or 6 different versions as daily drivers over the years, plus that many different Android devices.

In other words, if the point of the iPhone vs Android debate is to signal something about your socio-economic class is to signal something about _who I am as a person_ I could do that.

I've worked with businesses that have grappled with the economics of supporting both platforms, design teams full of fancy hair cuts and coastal sensibilities, hired Objective-C, Swift, Java, Kotlin, and React-Native engineers, and am personally a open source enthusiast.  I have a long relationship with Emacs, and am currently in the tail end of my 4th (?) 5-year cycle of living inside of it.  (I'm sure it'll be there when I get back.)

Anyway, lets take a look at why the Android "enthusiast" apps are the way they are.

## Hardware

First, iPhone hardware isn't that great.  Not only is the camera not "the best", but it [doesn't even crack the top 5](https://mezha.media/en/2022/12/22/mkbhd-has-published-the-results-of-this-year-s-blind-comparison-of-smartphone-cameras-pixel-is-back-again/).

That was taken 8 months ago, and the screen is all scratched up now and its constantly out of battery.  That's probably charging and usage habits more than anything, since I have a wireless charger near my bed and it never worked that well on the iPhone so she ends up plugging it in all the time and is looking around for a "apple charger".

And -- really? -- lightning connectors?  Remember when on their laptops Apple decided to drop everything except USB-C, and expected all the perifial providers to adapt?  And everyone did except Apple?

I have a Pixel 6 for what it's worth.  I have one charger that I use for all my devices.  (Makes packing easier.)  The back of the phone is cracked because 11 months ago the 5 year old dropped it when we were staying at this [cool lighthouse in Colombia](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/23248424?source_impression_id=p3_1683984022_MERXu0OrUuO71wbw).  The front is still unblemished, certainly a lot less scratched than the newer iPhone 14, so whatever.

Do I "think about switching back to an iPhone?"  (It get this especially from work people when I make them keep the Android version synced up, and push them on getting real notifications.)  And the answer is: no, I don't think about my phone.  The compelling reason to get a new one will be "when this one stops working".  And at that point, I would think about which phone to get.

## Objective realities

As of March 2023, [71.95% of devices are running Android](https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/android-vs-apple-market-share/).  This is more of an Apple to Google comparison, rather than about phones exactly since if you look at the top photo producing phones they are the Pixel, ASUS Zenfone, Oppo Find, and Samsung Galaxy.  I've never even heard of the Zenfone or Oppo.

There are 5 billion SMS users, 2.44 billion WhatsApp users, 2.35 Instagram users, and 1.3 billion iMessage users.  Which puts iMessage at roughly the same number of Facebook Messenger (1.3 billion) and WeChat (1.3 billion).  Still head of Telegram (550 million) and Signal (40 million).

iMessage is basically the American version of WeChat, in terms of it effectively being a regionally closed network, except its terrible.  What is up with the quality of videos that people try to send me?  (It's terrible because it pretends that its SMS, even though it is when talking to 71.95% of the population.)  Over in Apple town there's a distinction between green boxes and blue boxes, which I guess is like the lightning connectors, there to either make iPhone users lives hard or just to haze them.

And unline WeChat -- and all of the others, Telegram probably being the non-chinese standout here -- its not even a platform that people build functionality on.  WeChat has an entire non-web browser based ecosystem built around it, where you don't need to reimplment identity or authorization or payment to deliver a full client experience.  Telegram is filled with useful bots, or at least bots, useful or not.

iMessage a closed lock-in ecosystem but without any of the advantages.  Being green vs blue isn't something that is meaningful outside of the converted.  If they managed to get an iMessage app for Android I'd install it since it would help the iPhone user's terrible experience.  I interact with these things through the notification center anyway so the experience is the same if the message came in through Slack or WhatsApp or whatever.  It would cost me very little in other words, I get the sense that iOS users would have a better experience for it.

I'm not even going to mention Siri compared to Google Assistant.  How such an embarrising bit of technology ever got released by a company famed for "it just works" is a big head scratcher.  Google Photo's is still universes away from Apple Photos.

## The big reason

We see about 2 to 3 times the reveue for the iPhone versions of apps compared to the Android version.  [Tezlab's](https://tezlabapp.com) iPhone revenue is 2.3x the Android revenue.  In general iPhone users spend more money on software.  If you are in the business of selling software -- or selling anything really -- in the US the money is with the iPhone users.


Why is support for messaging so bad on Apple?  Why is Safari's support of PWAs so behind the specs?  They take the 

## Subjective je ne sais quoi

And lightning connectors -- how do you live like this?   It's a straight up [anti-consumer move](http://catb.org/jargon/html/C/connector-conspiracy.html), it's hilarous to me that the plug for the computer is somehow different than the plug from the computer.  For a long time the apple laptops made a stand that all they needed was USB-C and the perifial world would just have to adapt.  And everyone but **Apple** did.

iPhone cameras are totally fine from my point of view, though they don't score [particularly high in a blind comparison](https://mezha.media/en/2022/12/22/mkbhd-has-published-the-results-of-this-year-s-blind-comparison-of-smartphone-cameras-pixel-is-back-again/).  None of the iPhones cracked the top-5 in terms of ratings, [full video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQdjmGimh04&pp=ygUMbWtiaGQgY2FtZXJ), but honestly they've long since been good enough for most people's use.

So, in short, it was 15 years ago when the iPhone hardware had a 5 year head start over everyone else.  Those times have long since passed.
