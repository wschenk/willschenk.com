<p><a href="http://prostheticknowledge.tumblr.com/post/166858631126/progressive-growing-of-gans-for-improved-quality">Neural network image synthesis</a>: artificial intelligence systems are really good at generating super-realistic, fake images. Like the faces of celebrities.</p>
<p>Given the synthesised images can be made to be very similar to one-another, it's possible to make a long chain of synthesised images - all faces, all similar to the one previous - and turn <em>that</em> into an animation.</p>
<p>Resulting in this video: <a href="https://youtu.be/36lE9tV9vm0">One hour of imaginary celebrities.</a></p>
<p>It's like David Lynch took over the Daily Mail showbiz section.</p>

<p>Mapping startup <em>Mapzen</em> put together some slides of gorgeous forms and lines, abstracted from maps.</p>

<p>Dinosaurs aren't drawn right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dinosaur illustrations should take more cues from animals living today. Our world is full of unique animals that have squat fatty bodies, with all kinds of soft tissue features that are unlikely to have survived in fossils, such as pouches, wattles, or skin flaps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's what <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/dinosaurs-art-paleoartists-mistakes">present day animals would look like, if we drew them as badly as we draw dinosaurs.</a></p>
<p>The illustration <q>Swans imagined as though they were featherless dinosaurs</q> is particularly terrifying.</p>
<p>Of course we're not talking about about dinosaurs <em>now</em> because they are indeed now particularly skinny, being skeletons.</p>
<p>This is in relation to millions of years ago, before the dinosaurs got raptured, before we used their fermented meat to drive our cars.</p>
