Last August we covered the phenomenon of [this offline-only site](https://chris.bolin.co/offline/) from Chris Bolin. It forced you to be offline to view the actual message Chris was trying to share.

For Chris, it was about communicating the general hum of distraction and interruption we all face from constantly being connected. It's something we've become very comfortable with. So much so, that **to go offline requires deliberate intention**. It's hard to do.

Chris Bolin:

> Do you want to be productive? Just go offline, because **to maintain a constant connection to the internet is to maintain a constant connection to interruptions** , both external and internal.

Well, we totally missed [this breakdown](http://formidable.com/blog/2017/building-an-offline-only-website/) of how he built that site (he published that a few months later) and we also didn't notice [the offline site is on GitHub](https://github.com/chrisbolin/offline) so you can view the code and even [contribute by translating it](https://github.com/chrisbolin/offline/issues/3) to your language.
