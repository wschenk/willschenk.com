Laziness is one of the three great virtues of a programmer (laziness, impatience, and hubris) Larry Wall talked about in [Programming Perl](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596004927.do).

> The "deep thinking," as they call it, which is always required before even a small issue can be resolved, seriously turns me away from programming. Or did turn me away. Until I started to think differently and encourage myself to be lazy. Here is how.
