The Secret History

[rogerrogerwhatsyourrvectorvicto is looking for](https://ask.metafilter.com/325817/Sinister-Bildungsromans-Help-me-find-more-books-in-my-favorite-genre) "a specific type of novel that is the definition of "comfort" for me - a loner attends a school/college, is adopted by an inner circle (usually led by one charismatic member), and after a period of euphoria realizes that there's something sinister afoot."
