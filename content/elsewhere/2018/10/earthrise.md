Earthrise tells the story of the first image captured of the Earth from space in 1968. Told through the voices of the Apollo 8 astronauts themselves, the film recounts their experiences and memories and explores the beauty, awe, and grandeur of the Earth against the blackness of space. Read the story here. (Thanks Bobby)
