My biggest take away from this epic announcement from ZEIT? The support of the majestic monorepo!

> … **Now 2.0 enables what we will call The Majestic Monorepo** , inspired by a similarly named essay by DHH, creator of Ruby on Rails ([The Majestic Monolith](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith-29166d022228)).
> 
> We don’t agree that you should be orchestrating a big server abstraction (a monolith), but we believe you should be able to collocate your APIs and your business logic in a single place, with a cohesive deployment story.
> 
> **It looks, feels and deploys like a monolith, with none of its downsides.**

…but there is SO MUCH MORE to this announcement. Also, we talked a bit about David’s idea of The Majestic Monolith on [The Changelog #286](https://changelog.com/podcast/286).
