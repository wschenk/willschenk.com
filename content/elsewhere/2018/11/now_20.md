<p>My biggest take away from this epic announcement from ZEIT? The support of the majestic monorepo!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…<strong>Now 2.0 enables what we will call The Majestic Monorepo</strong>, inspired by a similarly named essay by DHH, creator of Ruby on Rails (<a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith-29166d022228">The Majestic Monolith</a>).</p>
<p>We don’t agree that you should be orchestrating a big server abstraction (a monolith), but we believe you should be able to collocate your APIs and your business logic in a single place, with a cohesive deployment story.</p>
<p><strong>It looks, feels and deploys like a monolith, with none of its downsides.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>…but there is SO MUCH MORE to this announcement. Also, we talked a bit about David’s idea of The Majestic Monolith on <a href="https://changelog.com/podcast/286">The Changelog #286</a>.</p>
