<p>From installing Mac’s command line developer tools (Xcode), Homebrew, Git, npm, to your code editor — Michael Uloth walks you through all the steps and details to get a new Mac ready for web development.</p>
<p>This guide is a good start and purposely leaves out items that aren’t strictly required for web development. If you’re into automation and tweaking things, then <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop">thoughtbot/laptop</a> is another route to consider. It automates most of Michael’s steps and <a href="https://github.com/adamstac/laptop">can also be customized</a> to install only exactly what you want.</p>
