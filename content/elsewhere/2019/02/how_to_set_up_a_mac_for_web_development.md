From installing Mac’s command line developer tools (Xcode), Homebrew, Git, npm, to your code editor — Michael Uloth walks you through all the steps and details to get a new Mac ready for web development.

This guide is a good start and purposely leaves out items that aren’t strictly required for web development. If you’re into automation and tweaking things, then [thoughtbot/laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop) is another route to consider. It automates most of Michael’s steps and [can also be customized](https://github.com/adamstac/laptop) to install only exactly what you want.
