If youâ€™re a tmux user, but youâ€™ve never heard of [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator)â€¦ itâ€™s time to fix that. [Simon van Dyk](https://twitter.com/siefi) has a solid intro to it on Thoughtbotâ€™s blog:

> tmuxinator is a ruby gem that allows you to easily manage tmux sessions by using yaml files to describe the layout of a tmux session, and open up that session with a single command.

Iâ€™ve been using tmuxinator for years and highly recommend it. ðŸ‘Œ
