<p>If youâ€™re a tmux user, but youâ€™ve never heard of <a href="https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator">tmuxinator</a>â€¦ itâ€™s time to fix that. <a href="https://twitter.com/siefi">Simon van Dyk</a> has a solid intro to it on Thoughtbotâ€™s blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tmuxinator is a ruby gem that allows you to easily manage tmux sessions by using yaml files to describe the layout of a tmux session, and open up that session with a single command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Iâ€™ve been using tmuxinator for years and highly recommend it. ðŸ‘Œ</p>
