## “Lichenia: A City Building Game for the Anthropocene"&nbsp;

by [@ **molleindustria**](https://twitter.com/molleindustria) Lichenia is an organic, experimental ‘SimCity’ / story-game, where you place enigmatic tiles, observe their environmental effects, and then try and build in the wake of climatic disaster”

> _[Lichenia](http://molleindustria.org/lichenia)_ is a new web-based game from game designer Molleindustria (Paolo Pedercini) that’s [about](http://www.molleindustria.org/blog/lichenia-release-notes/) “reshaping the natural and built environment, reclaiming dead cities, and growing sustainable ones.” It takes a few minutes to get going, but what else would you expect? Resurrecting a poisoned world is hard.
