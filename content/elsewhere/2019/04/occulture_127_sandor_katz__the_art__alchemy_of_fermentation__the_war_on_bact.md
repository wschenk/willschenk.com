Sandor Katz in the house to talk to us a bit about the art and alchemy of fermentation. Sandor is a New York Times bestselling author. His books include Wild Fermentation and The Art of Fermentation, both of which we drew on for the chat here.

Fermentation is one of the steps in the ancient alchemical process, both the material and spiritual versions. It’s also an easy and practical way to reclaim your food and your health, because fermented foods are easy to make yourself and can help revitalize your gut microbiome, which has become quite the hot topic in health and wellness circles in the last couple years. And we get into that as well, this war on bacteria that a lot of us are unknowing participants in. Hopefully after this chat we’re a bit more comfortable with the culture growing inside and on us.
