Linda Perry is one of the only women considered a go-to producer in the music industry.

After finding success with her band 4 Non Blondes and their ubiquitous single, "What's Up?" (1992) Perry went on to write and produce for other artists.

She’s worked with Alicia Keys, Gwen Stefani, Celine Dion, Adele, James Blunt, Britney Spears. And reinvented the careers of Pink and Christina Aguilera.

Most recently she wrote with and produced a Dolly Parton record for the Netflix movie _Dumplin’ —_ which earned her a nomination for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical at this year's Grammys (she was the first woman nominated in 15 years).
