## Sand Dams: Transforming Lives in Drylands

Excellent Development is a not for profit organisation that supports rural, dryland communities to work their way out of poverty with dignity. We work with local partners to support communities to build sand dams - the most cost-effective method of catching and storing rainwater in drylands. Sand dams provide safe water for life and the opportunity to grow enough food to eat, store and sell. Sand dams empower communities, putting their future firmly in their own hands.
