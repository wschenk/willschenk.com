<p>Rick Rubin checks in with RZA on Zoom and finds out he&#39;s been peaking creatively while in quarantine. Their wide-ranging conversation covers RZA&#39;s first experiences with Hip Hop, ODB&#39;s parkour-like skills as a child, the spontaneity of classic Wu-Tang recording sessions, and how RZA almost gave up all of his earthly possessions to live with monks in China&#39;s Wudang Mountains.</p><p><br /></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast">https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a></p><p><a href="https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/">https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href="https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>
