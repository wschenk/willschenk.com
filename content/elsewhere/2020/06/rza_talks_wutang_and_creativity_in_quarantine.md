Rick Rubin checks in with RZA on Zoom and finds out he's been peaking creatively&nbsp;while in quarantine. Their wide-ranging conversation covers RZA's first experiences with Hip Hop, ODB's parkour-like skills as a child, the spontaneity&nbsp;of classic Wu-Tang recording sessions, and how RZA almost gave up all of his earthly possessions&nbsp;to live with monks in China's Wudang Mountains.
