He is the author of [**_The Fabric of Reality_**](https://www.amazon.com/Fabric-Reality-Parallel-Universes-Implications-ebook/dp/B005KGJX8E/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20) and [**_The Beginning of Infinity_**](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World-ebook/dp/B005DXR5ZC/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20), and he is an advocate of the philosophy of [Karl Popper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper).&nbsp;
