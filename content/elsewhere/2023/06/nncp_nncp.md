NNCP is a versatile communications layer that can effectively route over anything, supports file transport and remote execution, and is protected by end-to-end encryption and good security. NNCP works with "packets" which carry data and can be an arbitrary size. NNCP operations include file transmission and remote command execution. NNCP can be transported over a mountable filesystem, a tar-like stream, or over the network. NNCP also supports advanced routing such as via routing and multicasting areas. NNCP is a powerful tool for building Asynchronous Communication networks.
