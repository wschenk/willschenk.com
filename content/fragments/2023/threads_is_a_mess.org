#+title: threads is a mess

I signed up for Threads today.  Down, click, click, and suddenly I'm
seeing a wall of random stuff.  A post from a Kardashian.  Influencers
commenting on brands.  No idea why I'm seeing any of it.

At first I thought it's because someone I'm connected with on
Instagram commented on it, but honestly I don't know why anyone would
want to talk to Netflix unless it was a customer service complaint.

What I expected was that I'd see the people on Instagram that I
followed.  This content I'm seeing here never needed to be discovered.
