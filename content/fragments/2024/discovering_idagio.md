I was a [primephonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primephonic) user
before it got whisked away into the Apple ecosystem, and sort of fell
back on Spotify.  I recently discovered
[idagio](https://www.idagio.com/) and I'm amazed at the quality.
Originally I was thinking that the classical services were better
because they organized the music in a more sane way, so you could hear
5 different renditions of a particular piece.

Each recording though isn't just different; it's like Spotify licenses
the cheapest one to get.  The playing on this particular one really is
phenomenal.
