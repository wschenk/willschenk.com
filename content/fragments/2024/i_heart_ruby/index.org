JavaScript has won, so of course I've been moving more into typescript
and javascript.  And these last few weeks as I've been going deeper
into the world of AI and LLM I've been dipping into the python
ecosystem.  And... I'm not convinved.

Obviously you need to go to where the libraries are but ruby is still
the most delightful.
