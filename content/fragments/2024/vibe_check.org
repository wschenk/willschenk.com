On the web I started with chatgpt, and it turns out that it makes more
sense than claude or gemini.

Though gemini is way faster.

In emacs I started with Zephyr, and you know? I think it just does the
best with defining words.  (Which is what I use the most in emacs)

With coding, I started with claude in cursor, and man it really kills
it.  I switched to chatgpt and you know it just wasnt the same.

So, basically, you just like the thing you used first and there's no
objective measure to anything.
