The context window on Gemini is really amazing.  Both for the main app
as well as [[https://notebooklm.google.com/][notebookllm]].  I've been pulling entire books down from
[[annas-archive.org][annas-archive]] and throwing them in, asking a bunch of questions,
pulling out quotes, having it do further searches, etc.

Truely amazing how deep it will let you get into a topic so quickly.
