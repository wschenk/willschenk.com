> Coined in 1987, the term Knowledge Navigator described a future computing system and how people might use it to navigate worlds of knowledge. In a sense, the user is actually the "Knowledge Navigator," though the term often refers to the systemâ€™s primary interface, a tablet computer. That part (i.e., the tablet) often stands for the whole system.
