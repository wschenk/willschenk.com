When I worked at a newspaper, we were rou-
tinely dispatched to “match” a story from the Times: to do a
new version of someone else’s idea. But had we “matched” any
of the Times’s words—even the most banal of phrases—it could
have been a firing offense. The ethics of plagiarism have turned
into the narcissism of minor differences: because journalism
cannot own up to its heavily derivative nature, it must enforce
originality on the level of the sentence.
