In the years following his major breakthroughs with microwaves,
thinking there might be a sort of electrical life to everything, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagadish_Chandra_Bose][Bose]]
began experiments on vegetables. He attached electric probes to
various vegetables, and claimed to record a "death spasm" in the form
of a spike in electrical activity. He hooked a cabbage to a voltmeter
in front of the playwright George Bernard Shaw, who was reportedly
horrified to witness the electrical "convulsion" of the cabbage as it
was dropped in boiling water. Shaw, it must be said, was a vegetarian.
