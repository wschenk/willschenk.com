From [Zhengdong Wang's 2025 letter](https://zhengdongwang.com/2025/12/30/2025-letter.html):

> I don't mind repeating Sutton throughout this letter because he wasn't even the first to say it. This year I had many edifying conversations about the unreasonable effectiveness of compute with my colleague Samuel Albanie, who alerted me to a prescient 1976 paper by Hans Moravec. Moravec is better known for observing that what's hard for robots is easy for humans, and vice versa, but in a note titled "Bombast," he marveled:
>
> > The enormous shortage of ability to compute is distorting our work, creating problems where there are none, making others impossibly difficult, and generally causing effort to be misdirected. Shouldn't this view be more widespread, if it is as obvious as I claim?
