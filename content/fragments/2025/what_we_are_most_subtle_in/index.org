Because for many
thousands of years it was thought that things (nature, tools, property
of all kinds) were also alive and animate, with the power to cause
harm and to evade human purposes, the feeling of impotence has been
much greater and much more common among men than it would otherwise
have been: for one needed to secure oneself against things, just as
against men and animals, by force, constraint, flattering, treaties,
sacrifices - and here is the origin of most superstitious practices,
that is to say, of a considerable, perhaps preponderant and yet wasted
and useless constituent of all the activity hitherto pursued by man! -
But because the feeling of impotence and fear was in a state of almost
continuous stimulation so strongly and for so long, the feeling of
power has evolved to such a degree of subtlety that in this respect
man is now a match for the most delicate gold-balance. It has become
his strongest propensity; the means discovered for creating this
feeling almost constitute the history of culture.
