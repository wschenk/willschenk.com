The singularity started somewhere around Thanksgiving 2025. Maybe it
was [Opus 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5), maybe
it was just everything in the air, but we hit the point where the
future is genuinely different from the past. There's a kind of
imagination block where we don't even know how to think about what
comes next. There will be a transition to something else -- it's
actually quite different to have intelligence everywhere in the world.

In the physical world, [Full Self
Driving](https://www.tesla.com/fsd) is magical. I expect a
two-and-a-half hour drive from the country down to the city to have
zero interventions. My flight last night was delayed, and I didn't
land until 1:30 am, and I was yawning the whole way from JFK to
Cornwall. I would have spent the night in the city since I wouldn't
trust myself to drive that tired, but it felt fine with FSD.

You get in the car, tell it where to take you, press "go" and then
you don't need to do anything other than open the door after it parked
you at your destination.

On the virtual side, I split my time between
[Cursor](https://cursor.com/) and [Claude
Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview). I
have it keeping the company organized, doing things on the internet
for me, and of course producing a shocking amount of software.

From the consumer side, I use the [Claude](https://claude.ai/) app
and [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) a lot. I rarely use
[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) anymore -- only for the voice stuff
on its app, when I'm driving in the car.

Also I'm getting really into family infographics.
