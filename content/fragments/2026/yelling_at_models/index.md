I'm doing another fast, and we're at a phase where the model is
telling me: 

> that's the cortisol and adrenaline spike — your body is stressed
about the fuel shortage and it's dumping fight-or-flight hormones. Low
blood sugar + rising norepinephrine = irritability.

OK, maybe, but I need to stop myself from snapping at my loved ones.
I'm waiting for the kids right now at the ski lodge, and all the
tables are "reserved" by people leaving their backpacks underneath,
and I'm sitting at a table daring people to complain.

Of course, they don't.  It's all something in my head, but boy do I
have an elaborate feeling about yelling at them.

Luckily though I'm here using my 12 instances of Claude, and I get to say stuff like

> That's absolutely terrible no.

Or

> That's wrong, I need you to pause and think about it, then read the

And honestly, it sort of feels good.  I can just lash out, and then
`/clear` and it's all gone.

If it was an actual human on the other side snapping and yelling is
just a way to make a bad day worse.

This is an argument about the value of anthropomorphizing LLMs, though
I'm not sure it's for or against.
