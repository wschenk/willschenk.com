## A brief rant on APIs

I'm mainly focused on individual people who create things on the internet and the cool stuff that they create.  I'm very into technology so there's obviously a lot of that.  Some of this stuff is things that I personally create, like the photos from my phone, these little tutorials that I write up like this, and the random tweets and likes and whatever I leave around on the various platforms that exist.  

The platforms get their value from exactly that -- random people posting stuff to them.  In the very beginning of these platforms they try and make it as open as possible to encourage usage.  They spin the concept that this space is for everyone, that it's a natural commons that the members to do the work.  The feeling is that its a communally owned space.  Think of people creating photographs, licensing them under the creative commons and uploading them to flickr, or people filming videos and posting them to YouTube, having discussions on Twitter, creating podcasts and uploading them to the world, etc -- that makes these various platforms valuable.

When the companies start to violate the idea that its a community space -- and to be clear it's not an assumption that the users make, it's a deliberate communication strategy designed to obscure the fact that they own "the means of distribution", a sort of analogous "predatory lending practices" -- sometimes the community revolts.  These rebellions

Basically, what we need is to organize unions.  Join a member of the Union to control enforce privacy and data sharing policies!  

Because the value of the "platform" is created by the labor of the people using the platform.  Then things are done to try and extract value from that platform so that, I guess, the investors in the company can 100x their money or whatever.  And, to be clear, I'm into the idea of being able to capture the value of what you created.

I'm all for 100x your money building cool things and sharing them with the world, and then creating a space where people can connect with other people, salaries can be paid, kids fed and raised, whatever.  I build software for a living, I help entrepreneurs build companies, and I also personal invest in startups.  Having money is better than not having money.

What I don't like is that the neccessary-if-not-sufficient community gets less out of it as time goes on.  What I don't like though is the fact that these companies pull consistently close up their platform, platforms that would only exist based on freely shared things.  This strategy of building and then enclosing a commons is very destructive and demoralizing.

API access is a good way to enforce this control.  By explicitly defining the access, you can then control it, which becomes weakness when they inevitably pull it back.  Sometimes this is done for purely pragmatic reason -- I manage engineering teams for a living, and prioritizing maintaining an expensive feature that delivers a sort of business anti-value when there are high priority fires on the backlog is unrealistic, even without nefarious intent.  But it again says it's better to find alternate access to which is, at the end, your data.

The life cycle of API access is something like:

1. Its free and open, please build stuff off of it.
2. We freely take creative ideas from the community and roll it into the platform itself.
3. We grant API access solely to pre-approved use cases because technical reasons or privacy.
3. We need to limit the access to the API because monetization strategy.
4. The API is only available for partners.
5. We actively prevent automated interactions with the site because Russians, Chinese and North Korea and National Security.

In conclusion, I don't case what the EULA says.
