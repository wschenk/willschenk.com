Books and reading are a big part of my life. When a book hits you at the right time, ringing in your soul, it can resonate out in the harmony of how you conceive of the world and your place in it.  Sometimes the book isn't even considered good by the chattering classes but in the right place and the right time is can be just want you need.

On a slow week I read about 2 books; normally it's around 5. I go back and forth between paper copies and kindle-on-my-phone, but I vastly prefer soft cover books. The physical experience of hardcover books -- especially if the kids destroy the dust cover so the marketing flashiness is stripped away, which happens a lot in our house hold but feels like it violates the book's integrity -- makes them seem more important and timeless than they are, but softcover books are way more pleasant to actually, you know, read.

There are two images that I remember vividly from this book that we read in middle school: one is a scene where our two heros had spent overnight in their camp "out in the wilderness" and they woke up the next morning seeing the footprints of their parents who had come in the middle of the night to presumably see if they were ok. In the beginning of the book there were stories about conflicts with other siblings and the parents "were unfair", and that image of the parents fighting against but ultimately respecting their independant schemes but also coming to make sure they were OK really stuck with me.  That one half-remember scene has greatly influenced my thoughts on parenting.

[Dirty Dancing](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092890/) came out about this time, which also dominated recess conversations. I grew up close to the Catskills, and that was all stuff that happened in the general direction of what we called The City, so it had a grown-up connotation. I kept on trying to recreate things from the book -- have you ever tried to make an arrow head from a stone?  It's not so simple -- rather than talking about the movie, which was sort of childish in the context of this sexy grownup-ness. And I was like, "yeah, the book is more interesting" and there was a point where the other kids were like "I guess that makes sense."  A fanastic movie by the way that I've seen a zillion times.  That shaped many of my ideas of the Catskills which is where we spent the summer so it was familiar territory.

From the perspective of 2020 both of these have very problematic representations of colonialism, class, and gender so thinking about sharing them with the kids now bring up a whole host of issues around which literature you want to expose these impressionable young minds to.

My aunt gave me this when I was 16, which greatly impressed my father. She is now a retired law professor and I always had the impression that my "marching to a drum beat that only I can hear" ways made us aliens to each other, but she was a grown up and I was a little pain in the ass so we can see who the mature one is. Nietzsche is, sort of like Ayn Rand, fundamentally adolescent literature where a large part of the appeal is the the raging against the machine divorced from any context of mutual responsibility. "Revaluation of all values" makes a lot more sense when you don't have anyone depending upon you and just ignore all the people you are dependant upon. (Rand is an embarrising idiot and I managed to dodge that bullet.) I still laugh internally everytime I think that when Thoreau was living "self-sufficiently" in the woods he still went home to his mom's house so she could do his laundry.

When I was a sophomore in highschool we could choose any book to do a book report on and, since I was on an existentialist kick then, I chose The Plague. The English teacher -- who was a great guy and I generally had positive feelings about him and the class -- gave me a list of topics to write about on the book and I thought they were inane and missed the point of the book so I ignored him and went free style. In this time of The Rona I'm of course reading it again, but given how much differently I understand the book now (at 42 compared to 16) I was probably just an annoying little shit then and the questions were probably great. One thing that is striking about the book now is the first quarter where they talk about how everyone ignored and were otherwise oblivious to all the signs that it was happening that in retrospect was obvious.  Anyway, the book itself made less of an impact on me than this english class experience, which basically crystalized in my mind what a waste of time high school was and so it was a driving force to get me out of there and I went to "early college" in my junior year.

Where I ended up majoring in Math and Philosphy.  Every 7 or 8 years I will reread most of everything that Nietzsche wrote, and reading at each age in my life you experience the thoughts in wildly different contexts. It's hard to imagine someone as educated and intelligent as he was being produced in the world that we live in now.  After the 5Th or so reading I feel that I've gotten everything that I can out of it, but I'm sure I'll feel compelled to pick it up again and find something else.

Buddhism was big in our household and I read quite a lot of that. {{< bookshop isbn="9781570629334" />}} in particular I read a few times in a few different contexts, and I read {{< bookshop isbn="9781570627477" />}} by candle light when I was in Lhasa in the late 90s, back before the Chinese electrified and paved the town. But the biggest influence is more Taoism than Buddhism. {{< bookshop isbn="9780231105958" />}} has the "I had a dream that I was a butterfly, and when I awoke I didn't know if I was a man dreaming I was a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming than I was a man" zinger in it.
