	Will focuses on overall internal management of HappyFunCorp, which involves making sure that people are happy and productive, that clients are happy with their projects. This involves meetings and a lot oh psycology.  It's rewarding when the company is growing and thriving, but also very different from time spent immersed in the fun of computers.  The career grew out of the hobby, and now that my daily job is different from the hobby I can go back to being a hobby programmer. Coding for the pleasure of it.
