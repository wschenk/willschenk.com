        Will focuses on overall internal management of HappyFunCorp,
        which involves making sure that people are happy and productive,
        that clients are happy with their projects. This involves
        meetings and a lot of psycology.  It's rewarding when
        the company is growing and thriving, but also very different
        from time spent immersed in the fun of computers.
        The career grew out of the hobby, and now that my daily job
        is different from the hobby I can go back to being a
        hobby programmer. Coding for the pleasure of it.
