Need to receive [[https://cloudevents.io/][cloudevents]] from your [[https://nextjs.org/][NextJS]] app?  Me too!  You need [[https://github.com/smeijer/next-runtime][next-runtime]].

* Install

#+begin_src bash
  npm i next-runtime cloudevents
#+end_src

* In =pages/indes.ts=

And then:


#+begin_src typescript
  import { handle, json } from 'next-runtime';
  import { HTTP } from 'cloudevents';

  export const getServerSideProps = handle({
      async post({ req }) {
          console.log( req.body )
          console.log( req.headers )
        
          const receivedEvent = HTTP.toEvent({headers: req.headers, body: req.body })
          console.log( receivedEvent )
          return json({ message: 'Thanks for your submission!' });
      },
      async get() {
          return json( {message:"ok"} )
      }
  }))
#+end_src

Took me a while to sort out, but it wasn't so hard.  Thanks [[https://twitter.com/meijer_s][meijer_s]]!
