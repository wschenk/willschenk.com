I was looking around a different projects that [[https://www.technovangelist.com/notes/annotated%20list%20of%20ollama%20web%20and%20desktop%20integrations/][integrate with ollama]]
and saw one about a telgram bot.  I rarely use telegram but it looks
like fun, so lets go through and plug it in.

* Setup the telegram bot.

[[Follow the instructions][https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot]] to create a bot.
The short answer is you need to message [[https://t.me/botfather][the botfather]].

Say =/newbot=.

Give it a name.  Give it an account name.  Save the API key.  Save
that stuff for later.

* Find your user id

Go to the [[https://t.me/userinfobot][userinfobot]] and say =/start= to get your info.

* Download =ruecat/ollama-telegram=

#+begin_src bash
  # Or some other directory
  cd $(mktemp -d)

  git clone https://github.com/ruecat/ollama-telegram
  cd ollama-telegram
#+end_src

Set it up

#+begin_src bash
  python3 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate

  pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_src

* Edit the config

| =TOKEN=           | Telegram token |
| =ADMIN_IDS=       | Your user id   |
| =USER_IDS=        | Your user id   |
| =INITMODEL=       | =llama3.1=       |
| =OLLAMA_BASE_URL= | =localhost=      |

Then

#+begin_src bash
  cd bot
  python3 run.py
#+end_src

* Conclusion

I had no idea it was so easy to create telegram bots!  That's super
fun.
