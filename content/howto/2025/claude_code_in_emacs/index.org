Claude Code provides a CLI interface to Claude that maintains full
project context and can execute commands directly. The claude-code.el
package integrates this into Emacs, giving you access to Claude's
capabilities without leaving your editor.

* Key Integration Points

** Project Scope Management
Claude Code operates on entire directory trees rather than individual
files. When you start a session from your project root, Claude has
read access to all files in that directory and can understand
relationships between components, build configurations, and test
files.

** Terminal Backend
The integration uses a terminal emulator (eat or vterm) to run Claude
Code's CLI. This means Claude can execute shell commands, run tests,
install dependencies, and interact with git - not just generate code
suggestions.

** Context Preservation
Sessions persist across Emacs restarts. You can resume conversations,
and Claude maintains awareness of previous changes made to your
codebase during that session.

** Error Location Awareness
The =claude-code-fix-error-at-point= function sends Claude both the
error message and surrounding code context, including file paths and
line numbers. Claude can then make targeted fixes with full
understanding of the error's location.

* Usage

** Starting Sessions
- =C-c c c= (~claude-code~): Start from current buffer's directory
- =C-c c d= (~claude-code-start-in-directory~): Select specific directory scope

** Sending Context
- =C-c c e= (~claude-code-fix-error-at-point~): Send error at cursor with surrounding context
- =C-c c r= (~claude-code-send-region~): Send selected region or current buffer
- =C-c c o= (~claude-code-send-buffer-file~): Send entire current file
- =C-c c s= (~claude-code-send-command~): Send arbitrary text command

** Session Management
- =C-c c C= (~claude-code-continue~): Resume last session
- =C-c c R= (~claude-code-resume~): Select from all previous sessions
- =C-c c k= (~claude-code-kill~): Terminate current session

* Working Patterns

** Directory Scope Selection
The choice of starting directory determines Claude's file access
scope. Starting from a project root gives access to build files,
documentation, and full source tree. Starting from a subdirectory
limits scope to that subtree, which can be useful for large monorepos
or when working with sensitive files.

** Multi-File Operations
Claude can modify multiple files in a single response when it has
appropriate context. For example, renaming a function will update its
definition, all call sites, tests, and documentation if they're within
the accessible directory tree.

** Terminal Integration
Commands execute in a persistent shell session. This means environment
variables, directory changes, and installed packages persist
throughout the session. Claude can run test suites, install
dependencies, and create git commits as part of its responses.

** Error Context
=claude-code-fix-error-at-point= sends the error message, cursor
position, and surrounding code context. This often provides sufficient
information for Claude to identify the root cause and implement fixes
across related files.

** Session Continuity
Conversations persist across Emacs sessions. Claude maintains context
about previous modifications and can refer to earlier parts of the
conversation when making new changes.

|-------------|----------|-------------|
| =C-c c c= | claude-code | Start session from current directory |
| =C-c c d= | claude-code-start-in-directory | Start session with directory selection |
| =C-c c e= | claude-code-fix-error-at-point | Send error context to Claude |

| =C-c c o= | claude-code-send-buffer-file | Send current file |
| =C-c c s= | claude-code-send-command | Send text command |
| =C-c c C= | claude-code-continue | Resume last session |
| =C-c c R= | claude-code-resume | Select previous session |
| =C-c c k= | claude-code-kill | Terminate current session |
| =C-c c m= | claude-code-transient | Open command menu |
| =C-c c b= | claude-code-switch-to-buffer | Switch to Claude buffer |
| =C-c c z= | claude-code-toggle-read-only-mode | Toggle text selection mode |

* Configuration Notes

The package requires a terminal emulator backend (eat or vterm) and
assumes Claude Code CLI is available in your PATH. The optional Monet
integration provides IDE features like go-to-definition within Claude
sessions.

Directory selection affects performance and response relevance. Large
codebases benefit from scoping to specific subtrees. The persistent
shell session means Claude can maintain state across multiple commands
within a session.
