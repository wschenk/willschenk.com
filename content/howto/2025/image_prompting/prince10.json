    "prompt": "Ultra High Resolution photorealistic image of 'The Little Prince with golden hair, dressed in green and wrapped in a yellow scarf, tenderly caring for a red rose on a small asteroid' award-winning, epic composition, ultra detailed. The subject is placed against the backdrop of a breathtaking Van Gogh Starry Night sky, swirling stars, oil painting, soft brush strokes, dreamy and whimsical. Every brushstroke has been painstakingly rendered to capture the light reflecting off of the thick oil paint, enhancing the vibrant colors that fill the scene with warmth and emotion. The Little Prince is a 20-year-old male with golden hair wearing a green jumpsuit and sporting a bright yellow scarf wrapped around his neck. He tenderly cradles a vivid red rose in his outstretched hands, holding it as if to protect it from harm. The rose, with its delicate petals, glows against the deep blue asteroid backdrop. The environment surrounding the subject is desolate yet picturesque - a small asteroid floating amidst the swirling stars of a Van Gogh-inspired sky. The asteroid's terrain is barren and rough, with sharp rocks and a few patches of soil that seem to hold onto life. The Little Prince appears at peace in this environment, his golden hair glistening under the soft brush strokes of moonlight. A gentle glow emanates from the background, casting long shadows across the scene. It reflects off the thick oil paint, creating a dreamy and whimsical atmosphere that captures the essence of Van Gogh's most famous works. The stars overhead shimmer with vibrant colors, their light reflecting off the rich textures of the oil painting and illuminating every detail with an ethereal glow. The photographer has carefully chosen a camera with a wide-angle lens to capture the entire scene, opting for a shallow depth of field to create a sense of depth and movement. The camera settings have been optimized for low light conditions, resulting in an image that is both clear and vividly colored. This photorealistic image is an artistic masterpiece, blending the realism of photography with the emotion and texture of oil painting. It tells a story of love, loss, and the beauty of life's fleeting moments - a tribute to both The Little Prince and Van Gogh's timeless work."
