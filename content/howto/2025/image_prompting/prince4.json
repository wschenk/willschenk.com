    "prompt": "Ultra High Resolution photorealistic image of 'The Little Prince with golden hair, dressed in green and wrapped in a yellow scarf, tenderly caring for a red rose on a small asteroid' award-winning, epic composition, ultra detailed. The subject, The Little Prince, stands out against the stunning backdrop of the Van Gogh Starry Night sky. His golden locks shimmer under the soft light reflecting off of the thick oil paint, while his vibrant green outfit and yellow scarf stand out in contrast to the dreamy nightscape around him. The environment best suited for this scene is a serene asteroid field dotted with small rocky formations. The Little Prince's presence on one such formation creates a sense of harmony between the natural setting and his gentle nature. The surrounding asteroids are adorned with soft brush strokes, reminiscent of the iconic Van Gogh style, as if these celestial bodies have been painted in the same oil paint used for The Little Prince's portrait. The whimsical and dreamy atmosphere is further enhanced by a subtle, ethereal glow emanating from the red rose The Little Prince tenderly cares for. This delicate flower seems to defy gravity as it floats gracefully above the asteroid surface, adding an element of wonder and enchantment to the scene. As you gaze upon this photorealistic image, you are transported into a dreamlike world where time stands still, and every detail appears as if it were painted onto canvas by a master artist. The use of oil paint in capturing the intricate textures of The Little Prince's garments and the swirling stars of the Van Gogh Starry Night sky creates an immersive experience that invites you to explore this mystical landscape further. The mood of the image is both dreamy and tender, evoking feelings of nostalgia, serenity, and wonder. The delicate balance between the vibrant colors and the soft brush strokes allows the viewer to become fully immersed in this enchanting world, where time seems to slow down, and every detail deserves close inspection."
