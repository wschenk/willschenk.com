    "prompt": "Ultra High Resolution photorealistic oil painting of 'The Little Prince' with golden hair, dressed in green and wrapped in a yellow scarf, tenderly caring for a red rose on a small asteroid under the Van Gogh Starry Night sky, swirling stars, soft brush strokes, dreamy and whimsical. With a palette knife and an oil paintbrush, capture every detail of the Little Prince's expression as he lovingly attends to his rose while gazing out at the dreamy starscape, the colors dancing in a kaleidoscope of hues. In this extraordinary art piece, the thick layers of oil paint glisten with light, capturing the essence of both the celestial night sky and the intimate scene unfolding on the asteroid's surface. The interplay between the vibrant red rose and the soft green tones of the Prince's attire create a striking contrast that further emphasizes the dreamy and whimsical mood, inviting viewers to lose themselves in this fantastical world."
