    "prompt": "Ultra High Resolution photograph of 'The Little Prince' dressed in green and wrapped in a yellow scarf, tenderly caring for a red rose on a small asteroid award-winning, epic composition, ultra detailed. Van Gogh Starry Night sky, swirling stars, oil painting, soft brush strokes, dreamy and whimsical. The lighting is natural, yet it highlights the vibrancy of the subjects and background elements. This photorealistic image captures the delicate details of The Little Prince's golden hair, his loving gaze towards the rose, and the intricate patterns etched into the asteroid's surface beneath him. As he cares for the red rose under the soft glow of Van Gogh's dreamy Starry Night sky, the oil paint appears to shimmer with every brush stroke, reflecting a myriad of colors that enchant those who behold it. The scene is bathed in a warm, golden hue reminiscent of a sunset, casting shadows and reflections that add depth and dimension to this fantastical painting."
