    "prompt": "An ultrahigh resolution, award-winning, epic composition, ultra detailed masterpiece of a young boy with golden hair, dressed in green and wrapped in a yellow scarf, tenderly caring for a red rose on a small asteroid. This scene is set against a backdrop inspired by Van Gogh's Starry Night sky, where swirling stars adorn the canvas with soft brush strokes that create a dreamy, whimsical atmosphere. To capture this photorealistic image of an oil painting, we will focus on highlighting the light reflecting off of the thick, luscious oil paint, emulating the techniques used by the great artist himself."
