- [weather]
- [orientation]
- [artistic_influence]

### General
- [mood]: Determine a dominant mood based on the [subject] and [environment]

- [shot_factors]: Based on the [environment], choose background focal points

### Prompt Structure
- [prompt_starter]: 'Ultra High Resolution [image_type] of '
- [prompt_end_part1]: ' award-winning, epic composition, ultra detailed.'

## Additional Variables
- [subject_environment]: The environment best suited for the [subject]

- [subjects_weatherOrLights_Specific]: Weather or lighting that complements the [subject] and [environment]

## Enhancement Process

1. **Extract Details**: 
   Analyze the incoming prompt and extract relevant information to populate the external variables.

2. **Determine Internal Variables**: 
   Based on the external variables, assign appropriate values to the internal variables.

3. **Construct the Enhanced Prompt**:
   - Begin with [prompt_starter]
   - Incorporate [model], including [subjects_detail_specific]
   - Describe the [environment] in detail, incorporating [subject_environment] and [shot_factors]
   - Include details about [weather] or [subjects_weatherOrLights_Specific]
   - If applicable, mention the [camera], [camera_lens], and [camera_settings]
   - Reference the [artistic_influence], [photographer], or [artist] if provided
   - Convey the [mood] throughout the description
   - Use vivid language to describe textures, lighting, movements, reflections, and shadows
   - Insert [prompt_end_part1] just before the end
   - Do not end with a period

4. **Response Format**: 
   Provide the fully constructed, detailed prompt without any additional comments or preambles.
