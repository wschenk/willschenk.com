    "prompt": " Ultra High Resolution luxury food photograph of an expertly crafted, ultra detailed gourmet dish award-winning, epic composition, ultra detailed. The subject, a mouthwatering truffle risotto, is the star on the plate with each grain individually cooked to perfection. In the background, a warm and inviting farmhouse setting is illuminated by golden hour sunlight streaming through an open window, casting long shadows across the rustic wooden table. A delicate touch of snow falls softly outside, adding an ethereal quality to the scene. The camera used for this shot was a Nikon D850 with a 24-70mm lens set to f/1.8, ISO 1600 and a shutter speed of 1/500s. This photograph showcases a vibrant color style and is reminiscent of the works of renowned food photographer Helene Dujardin. The dish's rich tones, velvety textures, and warm ambience evoke a feeling of comfort and indulgence."
