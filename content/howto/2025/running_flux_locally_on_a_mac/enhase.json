    "prompt": " Ultra High Resolution photography of an award-winning, epic composition of a sumptuous feast on a lavish table, featuring a 20-year-old female with blonde hair wearing a red dress as the subject, surrounded by luscious greenery and vibrant flowers. The camera used is a Nikon D850 with a wide-angle lens, set to ISO 1600, shutter speed 1/250s, and depth of field f/4, capturing the scene in natural color style, reminiscent of the works by renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz. The subject is bathed in warm, golden lighting that complements her radiant complexion, while the table setting consists of opulent silverware, crystal glassware, and a velvety tablecloth. A luxurious spread of gourmet food items adorns the scene: succulent roasted turkey with crisp skin, tender steak cooked to perfection, fluffy mashed potatoes, and a delectable array of freshly picked seasonal fruits. The feast is further enhanced by an assortment of sauces in ceramic pots, dripping onto the food to create tantalizing visual effects. With [prompt_end_part1] in tow, this photograph promises to transport viewers into a world of indulgence and opulence."
