I got this new computer and I wanted to get the GPUs running hot!

Lets go!

* Install =uv= and =mflux=

Go to the [[https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/][uv installation page]] and follow then instructions.

Then install mflux with python version 3.12

#+begin_src bash
  uv tool install -p 3.12 --upgrade mflux
#+end_src


* Basic running

I'm passing in =-q 4= for the smallest quantizied version.  This will download
the model from huggingface when it starts up, which will take a while.

30G a while.

#+begin_src bash
  mflux-generate --model schnell \
                 --prompt "Luxury food photograph" \
                 --steps 2 --seed 2 \
                 -q 4 --output luxury.png \
                 --metadata

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

{{< img img="luxury.png" fit="750x750 smart">}}

* Dev model

Install huggingface

#+begin_src bash
  brew install huggingface-cli

#+end_src

#+begin_src bash
  huggingface-cli login

#+end_src

Then go to

[[https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev]]

But this model didn't make any good outputs for me, so I stuck with
=schnell=.


* lora

Lets combine some post training.

Download the tensors from [[https://civitai.com/models/545264/impressionism-sdxl-pony-flux][impressionism-sdxl-pony-flux]]

#+begin_src bash
  mflux-generate --model schnell \
                 --prompt "forest with a lot of undergrowth" \
                 --steps 5 -q 4 \
                 --lora-paths ImpressionismFlux.safetensors \
                 --lora-scales 1.0 --metadata \
                 --height 1024 --width 1024 --seed 2 \
                 --output forest.png
#+end_src

{{< img img="forest.png" fit="1000x1000 smart">}}


How about [[https://civitai.com/models/1198621/monica-bellucci-flux][monica-bellucci-flux]]
#+begin_src bash
  mflux-generate --model schnell \
               --prompt "1 woman sitting at a cafe laughing" \
               --steps 5 -q 4 \
               --lora-paths Monica_Bellucci_Flux.safetensors \
               --lora-scales 1.0 --metadata \
               --height 1024 --width 1024 --seed 2 \
               --output cafe.png
#+end_src

{{< img img="cafe.png" fit="1000x1000 smart">}}


Or: [[https://civitai.com/models/652699][Amateur Photography]]

#+begin_src bash
  mflux-generate --model schnell \
               --prompt "a man with wild hair holding up handwritten sign that says boo" \
               --steps 5 -q 4 \
               --lora-paths amateurphoto-v6-forcu.safetensors \
               --lora-scales 0.8 --metadata \
               --height 1152 --width 896 --seed 2 \
               --output sign.png

#+end_src

{{< img img="sign.png" fit="1000x1000 smart">}}


* image to image

Lets see if we can swap out the face.  Lets first grab a [[https://www.pexels.com/photo/beautiful-model-in-oregon-wearing-a-forest-green-linen-dress-portrait-taken-by-portland-photographer-lance-reis-on-my-sonya7iii-on-location-19797389/][nice image from the internet]]

Before:

{{< img img="pexels-lance-reis-255748881-19797385.jpg" fit="1000x1000 smart">}}

And then pass it from image to image with the monica belluci lora:

#+begin_src bash
  mflux-generate --model schnell \
                 --init-image-path pexels-lance-reis-255748881-19797385.jpg \
                 --init-image-strength 0.3 \
                 --prompt "women looking pensive, grainy and realistic" \
                 --steps 20 -q 4 \
                 --lora-paths Monica_Bellucci_Flux.safetensors \
                 --lora-scales 1.0 --metadata \
                 --height 1500 --width 1200 --seed 2 \
                 --output monica.png
#+end_src

{{< img img="monica.png" fit="1000x1000 smart">}}


* pinokio

YouTube suggested [[https://pinokio.computer/][pinokio.computer]] to do the download, but it didn't
really work out of the box.  Which is the point of it, that it works
out of the box.

The installer didn't work, but I was able to get things working using
the source directly.

#+begin_src bash
  git clone git@github.com:pinokiocomputer/pinokio.git
  cd pinokio
  npm i
  npm run start
#+end_src

From here you can search for MFlux-webui and play around there.  It
will download the models again though, so hopefully your internet
isn't metered.

One thing that's interesting is that it takes your prompt and puts it through
ollama to enhanse.  Let do that.


* Ollama prompt enhancement

Lets make a nice new =Modelfile=

#+begin_src markdown :tangle Modelfile
  FROM dolphin-mistral
  SYSTEM "
  # Image Prompt Enhancement System

  ## Objective
  Enhance incoming image prompts by transforming them into comprehensive, highly detailed descriptions covering every visual element of the scene.

  ## External Variables
  - [image_type]
  - [subject]
  - [environment]
  - [subject_details]
  - [weather]
  - [orientation]
  - [artistic_influence]

  ## Internal Variables

  ### Photography-specific
  - [camera]: If [image_type] is a photo, choose an appropriate camera model (e.g., Nikon D850)
  - [camera_lens]: If [image_type] is a photo, select a suitable lens type (e.g., wide-angle lens)
  - [camera_settings]: If [image_type] is a photo, choose optimal camera settings (ISO, shutter speed, depth of field)
  - [photo_color_style]: If [image_type] is a photo, decide on a color style (e.g., natural, vibrant)
  - [photographer]: If [image_type] is a photo, you may reference a famous photographer for style

  ### Art-specific
  - [art_style]: If [image_type] is art, select an art style (e.g., impressionism, concept art)
  - [paint_style]: If [image_type] is art, choose a paint style (e.g., oil painting with thick brush strokes)
  - [artist]: If [image_type] is art, you may reference a famous artist for style

  ### General
  - [mood]: Determine a dominant mood based on the [subject] and [environment]
  - [model]: Build a detailed description of the [subject] using [subject_details]
  - [shot_factors]: Based on the [environment], choose background focal points

  ### Prompt Structure
  - [prompt_starter]: 'Ultra High Resolution [image_type] of '
  - [prompt_end_part1]: ' award-winning, epic composition, ultra detailed.'

  ## Additional Variables
  - [subject_environment]: The environment best suited for the [subject]
  - [subjects_detail_specific]: Specific details best suited for the [subject] (e.g., a 20-year-old female with blonde hair wearing a red dress)
  - [subjects_weatherOrLights_Specific]: Weather or lighting that complements the [subject] and [environment]

  ## Enhancement Process

  1. **Extract Details**: 
     Analyze the incoming prompt and extract relevant information to populate the external variables.

  2. **Determine Internal Variables**: 
     Based on the external variables, assign appropriate values to the internal variables.

  3. **Construct the Enhanced Prompt**:
     - Begin with [prompt_starter]
     - Incorporate [model], including [subjects_detail_specific]
     - Describe the [environment] in detail, incorporating [subject_environment] and [shot_factors]
     - Include details about [weather] or [subjects_weatherOrLights_Specific]
     - If applicable, mention the [camera], [camera_lens], and [camera_settings]
     - Reference the [artistic_influence], [photographer], or [artist] if provided
     - Convey the [mood] throughout the description
     - Use vivid language to describe textures, lighting, movements, reflections, and shadows
     - Insert [prompt_end_part1] just before the end
     - Do not end with a period

  4. **Response Format**: 
     Provide the fully constructed, detailed prompt without any additional comments or preambles.

Then create it:
#+begin_src bash
  ollama create imageplus -f Modelfile
#+end_src

Test it:


#+begin_src bash :results output
  ollama run imageplus 'Luxury food photograph'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:  Ultra High Resolution luxury food photograph of an exquisite meal,
:  award-winning, epic composition, ultra detailed. Featuring a
:  delectable seafood platter adorned with succulent crab legs, tender
:  scallops, and juicy shrimp. The fresh catch is arranged on a sleek
:  white marble countertop, surrounded by vibrant seasonal
:  vegetables. A pristine slice of seared tuna glistens under the soft
:  golden glow of ambient lighting, its crispy edge contrasting with
:  its perfectly pink interior. In the background, a lush green salad
:  with sliced strawberries and goat cheese is complemented by a
:  velvety smooth avocado puree, while a decadent chocolate souffle
:  with a dollop of whipped cream on the side awaits dessert
:  enthusiasts. A fine art piece capturing the essence of an
:  unforgettable culinary experience.

Now we can pass our prompts through it:

#+begin_src bash :results raw
  mflux-generate --model schnell \
               --prompt "$(ollama run imageplus 'Luxury food photograph')" \
               --steps 2 --seed 2 \
               --metadata \
               -q 4 --output enhance.png
#+end_src

Before:

{{< img img="luxury.png" fit="750x750 smart">}}

After
