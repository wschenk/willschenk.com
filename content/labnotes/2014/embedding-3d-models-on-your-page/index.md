Github has an [embeddable 3d model viewer](https://help.github.com/articles/3d-file-viewer/) that you can use to display a model on your site. The model needs to be hosted in a github repo, and the format is

`<script src="https://embed.github.com/view/3d/<username>/<repo>/<ref>/<path_to_file>"></script>`

Here's a model of me that we made using the [Structure 3d scanner](http://structure.io/) which is a fun device that plugs into your iPhone or iPad.

Pretty fun right?

The next thing you need to do is to get a 3d printer, so you can create action figures for your office.

End.
