## Make apps faster

Head on over to the [HappySeed website](http://seed.happyfuncorp.com) to get the latest version of HappyFunCorp's starter application toolkit.

HappySeed is a set of application templates to help you get started building out new sites. The main section is a rails application template plus a set of rails generators to help you get started with rails appliations quickly. These generators setup the configuration of the application in a standard way, and the full set of generators include many things for setting up a modern rails app and well as middleman apps.

You can update your command line tools by doing

```bash
$ gem install happy_seed
```

And then create rails apps, plugins, engines, and middleman static sites using the new `happy_seed` tool.
