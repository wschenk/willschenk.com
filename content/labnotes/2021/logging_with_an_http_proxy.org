I miss having Chrome dev tools when writing node applications, since I
often want to see what exactly the network traffic.  Here's a way to
easily setup a man in the middle proxy to look at all the traffic your
application is generating.

* Run the docker instance

First we first up the proxy with the web interface:

#+begin_src bash
  docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 mitmproxy/mitmproxy mitmweb --web-host 0.0.0.0
#+end_src

* Node ENV Variables

Then we set the proxy environment variable, and for node specifically,
tell it to not worry about self-signed certificates:

#+begin_src bash
  export HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:8080
  export NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED='0'
#+end_src

Then we run our script:

#+begin_src bash
  node outdated.js
#+end_src

Then go visit [[http://localhost:8081]] to see all of the requests that were made.

Simple and easy.
