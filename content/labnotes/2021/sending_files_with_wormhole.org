I saw this tweet this morning:

I've heard of the other things, but what is [[https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][magic wormhole]]?  Its a way
to send files from one computer to another using a magic phrase.  The
idea is that you are on the phone with someone, you send them a file,
say a phrase over the phone, and they use that phrase to get the files
to their computer.

Let's try it.  On Debian:

#+begin_src bash
sudo apt install magic-wormhole
#+end_src

Or OSX

#+begin_src bash
brew install magic-wormhole
#+end_src

* Sending a file

To send a file

#+begin_src bash
  $ md5sum Anarchist\ Design\ Book.pdf
  bb30cdf2185d40cff0e269a954f05d8e  Anarchist Design Book.pdf

  $ wormhole send Anarchist\ Design\ Book.pdf
  Sending 26.7 MB file named 'Anarchist Design Book.pdf'
  Wormhole code is: 1-glossary-neptune
  On the other computer, please run:

  wormhole receive 1-glossary-neptune
#+end_src

* Receiving a file

And then on the other side:

#+begin_src bash
  $ wormhole receive 1-glossary-neptune
  Receiving file (26.7 MB) into: Anarchist Design Book.pdf
  ok? (y/N): y
  Receiving (<-209.133.79.248:9245)..
  100% 26.7M/26.7M [00:11<00:00, 2.27MB/s]
  Received file written to Anarchist Design Book.pdf

  $ md5sum Anarchist\ Design\ Book.pdf
  bb30cdf2185d40cff0e269a954f05d8e  Anarchist Design Book.pdf
#+end_src

Fast and easy, at least once you have it installed!
