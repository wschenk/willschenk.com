Had a little trouble getting ruby 2.6.6 (actually openssl 1.1.1) to
install on the latest and greatest version of OSX, found a simple work
around:

#+begin_src bash
optflags=-Wno-error=implicit-function-declaration asdf install ruby 2.6.6
#+end_src
    
#+begin_src bash
  WARNING: ruby-2.6.6 is past its end of life and is now unsupported.
  It no longer receives bug fixes or critical security updates.
#+end_src
