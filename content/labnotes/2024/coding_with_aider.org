Here's an example of building out an app with aider that records
audio, sends it to OpenAI for processing, and shows the result.

* Installation

#+begin_src bash
  # Install aider
  python -m pip install aider-chat
#+end_src

Create a temporary directory and fire up aider

#+begin_src bash
  cd $(mktemp -d)
  echo OPENAI_API_KEY=$(op read 'op://Personal/OpenAI Key/notesPlain') > .env
  dotenvx run -- aider
#+end_src

* Chat transcript

Prompt 1: describe the project

#+begin_quote
create an express app that serves up an html and javascript files.
The app uses the media api to record a person talking, and then uses
the openai whisper api to convert the spoken text to speech.  When the
user stops the recording, there's a display that says "processing" and
when its done it gets replaced with the text that is spoken.  If
there's an error it gets displayed in that box.  openai needs to have
the right file extention so make sure its uploaded in webm and the
filename is preserved the example from the openai docs is

const openai = new OpenAI();

async function main() {
  const transcription = await openai.audio.transcriptions.create({
    file: fs.createReadStream("/path/to/file/audio.mp3"),
    model: "whisper-1",
  });
#+end_quote

Prompt 2: tell me what to copy and paste

#+begin_quote
what is the npm command i need to run to install of the dependancies?
#+end_quote

Run it:

#+begin_src bash
  npm install express multer openai
#+end_src

Start the server

#+begin_src bash
  dotenvx run -- node app.js
#+end_src

Prompt 3: Got an error, just paste it in

#+begin_quote
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'uploads/audio.webm'
#+end_quote

Prompt 4: what sort of madness is it doing
#+begin_quote
use the webm format
#+end_quote

Prompt 5: Restarting this server all the time is a pain

#+begin_quote
add a script to package.json that watches to see if any of the js
files change and restarts the command 'dotenvx run -- node app.js'
#+end_quote

This is better:

#+begin_src bash
  npm i nodemon
  npm run dev
#+end_src

Prompt 6: Its just adding to the audio file, making it longer and longer

#+begin_quote
it seems like when i record something it jsut gets added to the end of
the file.  when you get the upload have it be in a unique file
#+end_quote

Prompt 7: Nope looks like its on the server side

#+begin_quote
looks like its happening on the client side
#+end_quote

fin.
