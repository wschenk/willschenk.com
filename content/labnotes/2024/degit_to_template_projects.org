Ever wanted to pull down a github repo and have it all nice and clean
to work off of?

#+begin_src bash
  npm i -g degit
#+end_src

#+begin_src bash
  degit wschenk/sinatra-ar-template base-api
#+end_src

Unlike a clone or a fork, this gives you a clean directory with no
=.git=.  Which is cool, though I'd like it to keep the =.gitignore=
around...
