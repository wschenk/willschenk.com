#+title: Deploying static vite site on fly

This is sort of silly, but since I'm deploying something else on
=fly.io= I might as well keep everything together.

We are going to use =pierrezemb/gostatic= to hold the files, but build
our javascript front end into the =dist= directory first.  It will get
the enviroment variables from =.env.production=:

#+begin_src dockerfile
FROM node:20 as build

WORKDIR /app

COPY package* ./
RUN npm i

COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM pierrezemb/gostatic
COPY --from=build /app/dist/ /srv/http/
#+end_src

Now we have a nice and tiny little image.  Lets create the fly app:

#+begin_src bash
  fly launch --no-deploy
#+end_src

Edit the =fly.toml= file to switch the internal port to =8043=

#+begin_src toml
[[services]]
  http_checks = []
  internal_port = 8043
  processes = ["app"]
  protocol = "tcp"
  script_checks = []
#+end_src

And then =fly deploy=
