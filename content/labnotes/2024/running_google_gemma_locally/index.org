  ollama run gemma:7b " Write me a sonnet about a bumblebee"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
A fuzzy ball of gold, a worker's art,
A bumblebee, a silent heart.
With wings that flit, and pollen bound,
It journeys through, with grace profound.

The flowers bloom, a symphony of scent,
And bees dance, a dance of intent.
With nectar sweet, they gather their prize,
And spread their wealth across the skies.

The honey flows, a golden stream,
A treasure born of passion and dream.
A gift from bees, a sweetness found,
In every spoonful, joy is found.

So let us cherish these creatures of grace,
For in their work, a beauty finds place.
A bumblebee, a humble art,
A gift to us, a heart of gold.

* Looking at images

=gemma= doesn't yet seem to be able to look a local images, or at least
it's not clear how to make ollama let it do that.  But we can use
another model to see what it says.  Here's this picture:

{{< img img="PXL_20210807_134615347.MP.jpg" fit="500x500 smart r270">}}

Then

#+begin_src bash :results output
  ollama run llava "tell me what do you see in this picture? \
         ./PXL_20210807_134615347.MP.jpg"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: The image shows a group of people, likely family members, 
: peering through an open window or hatch in the interior of a
: building. It appears to be a home setting, possibly in a loft
: area given the structure of the wall with a wooden panel. The
: children are on the top bunk, looking down at the adult
: standing in the doorway below them. They seem to be curious
: about their surroundings, and the adult is looking up at them
: with an expression that might suggest they've been caught or
: asked to come back inside. The environment looks cozy and
: lived-in, suggesting a family moment captured candidly.
