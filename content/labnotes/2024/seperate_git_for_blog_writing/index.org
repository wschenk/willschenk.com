I write most of these posts in =org-mode=, but sometimes it makes sense to have the resulting files in its own repository.

[[https://willschenk.com/labnotes/2019/splitting_git_repos_and_workdirectories/][I wrote up how to do that]] but I keep on forgetting, so here's me writing it down again:


* Create a new gh repo:

#+begin_src bash
  gh repo create wschenk/name --public
#+end_src

Add that into the front matter as =#+remote: https://github.com/wschenk/name=

* Pull it down

#+begin_src bash
  seperate-git.bash status
#+end_src

* Add the files

#+begin_src bash
  seperate-git.bash add .
#+end_src

#+begin_src bash
seperate-git.bash commit -m "initial commit"
#+end_src

* Push the files

#+begin_src bash
seperate-git.bash push origin main
#+end_src

easy-peasy
