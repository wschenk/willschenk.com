Ascii Cinema is a tool that helps you record interactions on the
terminal and then turn them into little movies that can be embedded on
a page. Let's install and run it!

#+begin_src bash
  brew install asciinema
  brew install agg
#+end_src

* Start the recording

#+begin_src bash 
  asciinema rec demo.cast
#+end_src

Do what you need to do in the terminal, then =exit= out.  You should get

#+begin_src bash
  asciinema: recording finished
  asciinema: asciicast saved to demo.cast
#+end_src

* Make a gif

#+begin_src bash
  agg demo.cast demo.gif
#+end_src

or

#+begin_src bash
  agg --theme monokai --font-size 20 --speed 2 demo.cast demo.gif
#+end_src

Which will give you something like

{{< img img="demo.gif" >}}

* Upload to the server

#+begin_src bash
  asciinema upload demo.cast
#+end_src


{{< img img="upload.gif" >}}

If you go to the url embed url, you will be able to see your cast.

You can also go to the connect url, which will prompt you to create an
account with your email address.

Do that and you should be able to see your unlisted upload.
