I like to have my projects open and close cleanly and easily. Here's a
way to have your dev server start up when you open up your VS Code or
in my case cursor projects.

Create a =.vscode/tasks.json=:

#+begin_src javascript
  {
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
      {
        "label": "dev",
        "type": "shell",
        "command": "npm run dev", // or your specific dev command
        "isBackground": true,
        "problemMatcher": [],
        "presentation": {
          "reveal": "always",
          "panel": "new"
        },
        "runOptions": {
          "runOn": "folderOpen"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
#+end_src


Now when you open up the projects, there will be a special tasks
window open up where your console and normal be and you'll be up and
going. As soon as you kill your window, the whole thing will shut down
and nicely go to sleep.

This is also very convenient if you set up a GitHub action so that
when you push your code deploys, so basically all you're doing is
opening up the thing, making some changes, committing, pushing,
closing it, you're done. It's now live.
