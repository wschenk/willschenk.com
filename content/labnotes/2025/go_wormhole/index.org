So using [[/labnotes/2021/sending_files_with_wormhole/][wormhole]] is cool, but there's a go version that's way easier
to install.  Since it doesn't need python.

#+begin_src bash
  go install github.com/psanford/wormhole-william@latest
#+end_src

And then you can use the normal

#+begin_src bash
  wormhole-william send language.zip
#+end_src

And the recv on the other side.

But the interesting thing for me is that it /easy to install on [[https://github.com/features/codespaces][Github
Codespaces]]/.  So you can fire up a temporary machine, and if you need
to send something over very easy.
