But in less than three minutes, the gameplay video seems to embrace most everything solarpunk as I’ve known it has been reacting against: soulless corporate aesthetics (covered up by plants), a future empty of diverse peoples and cultures, gunplay as the answer to delicate social and environmental problems, the centering individual heroes rather than collective action.</i><br></p></blockquote><p>Worth a read if you are interested in the future of Solarpunk and how is aesthetic will get used as it moves into its new more widely known phase in culture, out in the sun. I think it speaks to our communities need to continually restate our commitments to create a multitude of spaces for indigenous sovereignties, reproductive justice, and radical queer politics.</p>"
