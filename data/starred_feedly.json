But in less than three minutes, the gameplay video seems to embrace most everything solarpunk as I’ve known it has been reacting against: soulless corporate aesthetics (covered up by plants), a future empty of diverse peoples and cultures, gunplay as the answer to delicate social and environmental problems, the centering individual heroes rather than collective action.</i><br></p></blockquote><p>Worth a read if you are interested in the future of Solarpunk and how is aesthetic will get used as it moves into its new more widely known phase in culture, out in the sun. I think it speaks to our communities need to continually restate our commitments to create a multitude of spaces for indigenous sovereignties, reproductive justice, and radical queer politics.</p>"

If you search for articles about &quot;the Infocom drive&quot;, you'll see some discussion from years past. Actually, don't do that, it's mostly old arguments that don't need to be rehashed. The point is that a great deal of historical information about Infocom has been preserved -- but it's not publicly archived. You can't go research it anywhere. Nobody admits to having it, because it's &quot;proprietary IP&quot;, and you're not supposed to trade in that stuff because companies like Activision make the rules. So when Jason puts this information online, he's taking a stance. The stance is: history matters. Copyright is a balance between the rights of the owner to profit and the rights of the public to investigate, discuss, and increase the sphere of culture. Sometimes the balance needs a kick. Quite possibly all these repositories will be served with takedown requests tomorrow. I'm downloading local copies for myself tonight, just in case. If you're in a mirroring mood: curl &quot;https://api.github.com/users/historicalsource/repos?page=1&amp;per_page=100&quot; | grep git_url | cut -d \\&quot; -f 4 | xargs -L1 git clone Fun fact: Back in 2004, I got a very entertaining, hour-long phone call from Andrew Eldritch of The Sisters of Mercy. He wanted to talk, as he put it, &quot;on a matter not related to the music industry or Mozilla&quot;. In fact, he was calling me because he wanted to buy Infocom, and then give away all the games. This actually happened, I'm not making this up. He called me because, not being in the US, he was having trouble finding a sufficiently-mad US-based IP lawyer, and he figured I might know someone. I did! But obviously his purchase attempt did not succeed. I will never, ever forget that time Andrew Eldritch said to me, &quot;I knew that someone who has a picture of a vomiting clown on their web site couldn't be all bad.&quot;"

    "summary": "2018 marked history as the year when governments made tech giants responsible for election interference and tumult in democracy. Centralization and decentralization were central themes in cyberspace this year, while regulation and freedom also defined the rhetoric of many actors. We understood how closely cyberspace and meatspace affect each other, demonstrated by a couple of key events in 2018. FB and GOOG peaked (Source: Reuters) When the Cambridge Analytica data scandal was published on March 17th, FB stock took a big hit. In April, Zuckerberg appeared before U.S. Congress to testify, leaving answers that many felt were unsatisfactory. A few months later, as their Q2 earnings report demonstrated little to no growth, many investors immediately sold their stock, leading to 20% drop in price ($120 billion in value). Many seemed to realize that FB is not doing well, neither as a business, nor as a platform for humane discourse. As a result, FB stock prices this year went 2 years back in time, back to prices similar to early 2017. GOOG stock prices had a similar performance, as GOOG also received some negative press related to YouTube’s role in election interference, as well as leaks that revealed a deteriorating company cohesion, lower commitment to ethics, and protestable handling of sexual harassment incidents. Other Silicon Valley companies shared similar troubles. In 2017, Uber was a source of company culture scandals, but in 2018 its business showed signs of slowing. (Source: MarketWatch) The overall sentiment from the population has shifted: in a American poll of opinion, more people believe that social media hurts democracy more than it helps. The public perception of tech giants has gotten worse. In 2017, #DeleteUber was a trending hashtag. In 2018, it was #DeleteFacebook’s turn, causing more than 40% of young adults in the U.S. to delete the app from their phones. Even the co-founder of WhatsApp (a FB subsidiary) Brian Acton used the same hashtag to express his views, after quitting his position at FB. Other directors, such as Instagram’s (another FB subsidiary) co-founders, had a more graceful exit from FB. But the consistent message coming from many former executives, presidents and investors is that FB has crossed the line, becoming psychologically harmful and destroying how society works. The common themes for tech giants in 2018 were evaporation of reputation, and a decline in business. Their reputation got attacked internally and externally, from multiple angles and stories. This year, many discovered that these companies are darker than we thought. I am an outspoken critic of FB for years, but if you told me earlier this year that FB would hire Definers Public Affairs to lift negative stories on FB-critical senators, I would have dismissed that as an exagerated prediction. But this happened, and we’re all learning how dark these tech giants actually are, thanks to internal leaks and adversarial journalism. On the business side, it seems like these giants have saturated their products. FB’s Facebook growth has stalled in the USA, probably because more than 70% of Americans are regular (monthly active) Facebook users. GOOG focused on maintaining its current Search and YouTube ad revenue, while attempting to grow its AI efforts and Cloud business, where it still has not guaranteed leadership. GOOG is actually lagging behind when it comes to the Cloud, and its AI products are promising but are not yet reliable revenue streams. In 2018, GOOG also continued to discontinue many of its non-key products, such as Inbox, Google+ for consumers, and Fusion Tables, which harms its credibility as a reliable provider of services, important as a Cloud business. Less social networks (Unknown source, please contact me if you know who the author is) The sunsetting of Google+ for consumers is an important marker for the web in 2018, because it consolidates FB’s dominance in social networks. It’s not the first time that GOOG discontinues a large social network, Orkut was once a social network with dozens of millions of active users. Ironically, one of the reasons GOOG discontinued Orkut was the prospect of Google+ and its potential to replace Orkut. The problem with discontinuing small platforms (yet multi-million user large!) is that it removes consumer choice when the tide changes. Orkut was very popular among Brazilians, but began losing space to Facebook in 2009. However, now that Facebook’s credibility is decreasing, users have no choice of going back to a previous social network. This lack of platform competition is due to such platforms being proprietary. It is easy for one company to acquire and assimilate another social network. Companies do that because by joining platforms together they acquire more power and efficiency. It is also easier for companies to discontinue a platform, and they do that when the costs of running the platform don’t justify the small gains. Therefore, among proprietary for-profit social platforms, only the large and merged platforms tend to survive. Hence, Facebook. However, had the platform been a non-commercial open protocol (such as the Web or Email), its availability would be much more reliable and independent from any company’s seasonal performance, likely surviving for many decades. Another 2018 story on social networks was the content crackdown that Tumblr imposed on adult content, including artistic communities, that forced many users away from its platform. For many users it spelled the end of that social network. As a proprietary platform, Tumblr was first acquired by Yahoo, which in turn was acquired by Verizon in 2017. This means Tumblr is subject to the same instability and uncertainty that is inherent of a platform hanging on the decisions of a few business executives legally entitled to steer the platform. Regulation In the European Union, 2018 was the year when GDPR was switched on, requiring deep changes to a huge proportion of sites and internet services run by organizations around the world. For many sites targeting national (e.g. American) audiences, such as Chicago Tribune, GDPR compliance was not worth it, so these sites became unavailable to European readers. While GDPR may have sparsely helped in its original goal to increase user control over personal data, it had a role in furthering the balkanization of the internet, already norm in China. (Source: Chicago Tribune) The EU is aiming a lot of new regulation at tech giants and the internet at large. GDPR was not the only one, as Europeans are already familiar with the infamous cookie banner for years. While most of regulation is intended to limit corporate exploitation and protect user freedom, some new proposals, such as the Link Tax and Upload Filters may significantly harm openness and freedom on the internet. In September 2018, unfortunately, the EU Parliament decided to proceed with the proposal. Like GDPR triggered suddenly for many unprepared organizations, so may new legislation continue to add obstacles to internet traffic and rich information exchange globally. Many of these organizations may not find it cost-beneficial to serve European users anymore. NY-FB cyberwar In 2018 the press and FB became enemies. Last year I blogged about how the Web began dying in 2014 and it has to do with traffic sources to news sites. In the recent years, the online press became more dependent on FB and GOOG for the vast majority of their traffic, putting professional journalism at the mercy of these giant platforms. Moreover, large news sites often were in competition with lower-tier sensationalist fabricated articles spreading quickly on platforms like Facebook. Naturally, the press got upset. The New York Times this year had a storm of articles published specifically on FB scandals, too many for me to quote ([1] [2] [3] etc). Similar in tone, the New Yorker also had incisive stories to report. In Menlo Park, CA, Zuckerberg started the year by pledging to “fix Facebook”. Months later, after the turbulence caused by the Guardian’s and NYT’s articles about Cambridge Analytica, Zuckerberg adopted a war attitude internally at FB. The tense exchange between FB and NY press is logical, they are competing in the same market: attention and advertisement. And while FB denies that it is a publisher, what matters is that both FB and the press monetize eyeballs, and their competition for attention is a zero-sum game. AMZN / MSFT / AAPL soared Meanwhile, the other tech giants had an easier year, not occupying the negative spotlights in the press, not having to answer frustrated senators in Congress, and increasing their market capitalization. While FB and GOOG finished the year with -29% and -7% (respectively) stock value compared to the beginning of the year, AMZN and MSFT stock prices went up 17% and 14% (respectively). Jeff Bezos became the richest person on Earth in July. AAPL became the world’s first trillion dollar company, marking history. Soon after, though, AAPL’s value declined and MSFT was able to pass it and acquire the title of most valuable U.S. company. Because these tech giants are not competing in advertisement and are not surveillance capitalism companies, they had a much easier year in terms of publicity. While none of these companies are paragons of user freedom and privacy, people tend to place the blame mostly on FB and GOOG for psychological damage in social media addiction, misinformation, and political social engineering. Blockchain winter Cryptocurrencies peaked in value a few weeks before 2018 began, and after 12 months, all of the top cryptocurrencies saw a 70%+ drop in value. You could easily say the Bitcoin bubble burst, as many were already expecting in 2017. ICOs in 2018 raised 3 times more money than in 2017, but 2018 was not a great year for ICOs. Many people noticed a large amount of scam ICOs, and in the U.S.A. the government began the process of regulating ICOs and often classifying them as securities. The number of ICOs has been steadily declining since mid 2018. Overall, 2018 was a difficult year for cryptocurrencies, but there are plenty of respectable active projects to compensate for the scams, and even though cryptocurrencies entered the mainstream and casual discourse, we are still talking about an industry in its infancy. Cryptocurrencies will become center of attention again when the global stock market enters a recession and people look for alternative stores of value. At the very end of 2018, we may be already seeing this occuring, as stocks in America have entered a bear market around December 21st, and simultaneously major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have risen noticeably. Peer-to-peer grassroots When the topic is decentralized technologies, cryptocurrencies usually take the spotlight, but one ramification of decentralization are the non-blockchain peer-to-peer (P2P) projects, also known as the “Decentralized Web” (DWeb), such as IPFS, Dat, SSB, ZeroNet, Holochain, Solid, WebTorrent, Matrix, SAFE, GUN, Althea, etc. These have had a great year, although they are small in scale. One could say these P2P projects were behaving in 2018 like cryptocurrencies were in 2015-2016: not occupying mainstream discourse, but still promising, in active use, diverse, and thriving. The highlight of this movement was the Decentralized Web Summit that took place in San Francisco in August. Young pioneers and industry veterans were equally excited about the tangible innovation and opportunities ahead. Vint Cerf, inventor of the TCP/IP protocol, called it a historical summit. Tim-Berners Lee, creator of the WWW, was also present. On January 5th this year, as fellow developer André Garzia was working on Firefox extension for SSB called Patchfox, he wanted to add support for the ssb:// protocol in addresses, and sent a commit to Firefox to permit a few more decentralized protocols. I call this the DWeb big bang commit, it was a small effort but brought these protocols to public attention, as the commit ended up in the Firefox Update changelog, also leading to articles reporting about the change. Months later, Mozilla Hack’s blog featured a series of articles on DWeb protocols, Mozilla gave an open source grant to the Dat project, and began the libdweb experiment as a set of new browser capabilities useful for DWeb protocols, enabling TCP servers in the browser and even full IPFS nodes in the browser. Other browsers started catching up with Firefox: Chromium began discussion to permit new decentralized protocols following Firefox’s example. There is now a website where you can check how well do major browsers support the DWeb: arewedistributedyet.com. I have to say, in January I predicted this would happen. That said, the one browser that took the DWeb spotlight was undoubtedly Beaker Browser, which this year had a redesign, several conference talks, and a thriving community of creators, which is indicative of a successful project. Beaker’s success so far has been making authoring and publishing a first-class experience of the web, not as data submitted to a server, but as actual HTML sites authored from scratch. It’s a love letter to the web’s original design: “the creation of new links and new material by readers, [so that] authorship becomes universal”. On the social side of the web, Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB)’s community grew to over 10k accounts and 100k connections, Manyverse was launched as the first SSB mobile app (by yours truly), and the wider community received significant funding from Handshake. In other projects, significant advancements happened in 2018 like OSCoin’s release of Radicle, and the rise of Holochain. There’s too many news to fit in this article, but the bottom line is that decentralized web projects are now beyond experiments, they are working hard towards maturity and beginning to develop end-user apps. These projects have also appeared on the radar of tech companies, also literally, as ThoughtWorks marked IPFS as an ‘assess’ item in its tech radar. IPFS also took headlines when Cloudfare decided to setup a IPFS gateway, providing a web-accessible endpoint to content hosted throughout IPFS nodes. Another company aware of the DWeb is Samsung, which announced this year the Samsung NEXT Stack Zero Grant specifically to the peer-to-peer web and decentralized projects. The DWeb also got mentioned in higher ranks, when Rep. David Cicilline was questioning Google CEO Sundar Pichai in Congress and said “Along with 83% of americans, I strongly support an open decentralized internet that is free of powerful gatekeepers”, echoing Tim-Berners Lee’s articles on re-decentralizing the web. 2019? To the best of my estimates, I can give some predictions for 2019 or early 2020. There will be a global economical recession. We are certainly in the latter stages of an optimistic period, and with political instability, US-China trade wars, and tech giant underperformance, the economy is fragile for any event that will tip it towards pessimism. This will affect tech giants directly, because they are all publicly traded companies, and one could say we’re already seeing the beginnings of recession since October 2018. FB will devaluate steadily throughout 2019. It might spike up in reaction to some good decisions, but the tendency will be downwards, because the overall economy will be difficult, and because of FB’s own issues. The sentiment around Facebook.com will also continue to decay, but keep an eye on Instagram and WhatsApp. Even if all Facebook.com users join the #DeleteFacebook movement, they are much less likely to delete their WhatsApp and Instagram apps, and many don’t even know that FB owns all these products. FB knows this, and they will defend the business and user experience in those apps. Supposing Facebook.com dies (I don’t think it will), WhatsApp and Instagram can be FB’s second chance of getting it right. Maybe Zuckerberg apologized for Facebook so much because that is where all the mistakes were committed, maybe their next platforms will be better. There are talks that FB should be broken apart, one company for each of these products, but FB will do everything (also lobbying) to avoid a breakup of their social monopoly. Overall, although FB constantly occupies scandalous news headlines, we are underestimating FB. No other platform has made 90%+ of (non-China) internet users their monthly active users (2.6 billion users of FB products, divided by 3.5 billion non-China internet users), which means if any two random persons want to be in contact over the internet, the easiest way is very likely to be through FB products. That is of immense value and does not die out quickly, and it is hard to compare the hypothetical sudden death of Facebook to other sudden deaths of other internet platforms, because literally no other internet platform has yet been as large as Facebook. I myself am blocking both GOOG and FB services from my computer for 2+ years, and I recognize that it is vastly easier to stop using GOOG services than it is to be outside FB products. I am constantly reminded that I am excluded from a lot of social activities, and I know that my choice also causes an uncomfortable social burden on others. My search engine choice does not cause that same effect. New York’s press war with FB has most likely caused people to be aware of the ethic underperformance of FB executives, but this is not much different to discovering that your country’s politicians and leaders are corrupt. It’s enraging, it’s protestable, and maybe if you try hard enough with enough mass coordination you can make a change, but it’s still a centralized authority so much more powerful than you are, that it leaves you feeling powerless to make a difference or even change your habits. This is just one more symptom that FB is a Net State: it has a huge population (userbase), citizen identity (login/account), constitution (content moderation rules), government (Zuckerberg and FB company), and now even other states (US government, EU, UK parliament, etc) are engaging with it and some of its citizens are protesting against it. FB as a Net State is also actively developing its Police capabilities, largely in reaction to the election interference scandals. However, this is not exclusively because of election interference, it would anyway be an inevitable next step for a Net State. See Zuckerberg’s post “A Blueprint for Content Governance and Enforcement”. Let me highlight one word in that title to make it very obvious: Enforcement. However, FB is also underestimating us. More than any other organization, FB understands memetics, a field of study on the human drive to imitate others and the viral spread of information and behavior. I remember watching Zuckerberg testify to Congress and being asked about the #DeleteFacebook movement, where he answered that it didn’t have a significant impact on the numbers. I knew at that moment that he was lying or purposefully underplaying that effect. Everything FB does, from press releases, to designing UIs and copying competitors is about memetic engineering. They know that no one really can stop a viral movement once it is fully unleashed, and they fear that the same mechanics that unlocked their exponential growth would cause their exponential evaporation. They fear not any single entity, they fear the power of many. GOOG in 2019 will get increasingly more boring, maintaining the basic leader position in Search, YouTube, Android, and Docs. They will keep on pushing for AI strongly, since that’s their core mission, but it’s unclear whether we will see significant AI breakthroughs in 2019 and 2020. Maybe something interesting, but not on the same revolutionary scale as iPhone in 2007. Not yet. They might also keep their tradition of discontinuing products, we might see one or two more discontinued GOOG products in 2019. Their cloud business is at risk of being (gradually) discontinued, unless perhaps by specializing in AI as a service. Keep an eye on AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, particularly if they can build strong AI competence. While GOOG and FB still take most of the top AI talent, they also receive a lot of negative press and their employees may be on the verge of quitting, while AI is a long-term battle. With immense budget, AMZN, AAPL, and MSFT are actually good incubators for AI technology. Cryptocurrencies will have a good 2019. Most likely not an exponential kind of growth, maybe just linear or super-linear growth. While many have considered cryptocurrencies defeated after the bubble burst in late 2017, cryptocurrencies behave financially very differently than startups, growth companies, or commodities. These are open source and permissionless databases, which mean they don’t die easily. Growth companies have budget runways, commodities are subject to specific kinds of supply and demand. But open source and open data do not die, not until everyone has lost interest. Cryptocurrencies most likely have many winters, and experience the hype cycle multiple times, each plateau of productivity blending quickly with the next peak of inflated expectations. Regulation of both tech giants and cryptocurrencies will tighten in 2019. Governments have barely woken up to the power these two cyberforces have on real society, and since they take months and years to reactively regulate, 2019 will show regulation meant for a world from 2016, both from the EU and the USA. A first step might be the USA copying parts of EU’s GDPR. Regarding DWeb projects, in 2019 a few (maybe one or two) larger organizations may make experimental use of decentralized protocols such as IPFS, Holochain, SSB, Dat. These might be in absolute numbers small advancements, but still significant to scale up these projects by one order of magnitude, which is considerably bigger, but tech giants are still 4 orders of magnitude bigger. Funding will be a challenge for these projects, and maybe in 2019 a few such projects might lose momentum due to lack of resources. Another challenge will be the UX Gap. Currently, internet users are served top-notch user experience from centralized services, but are dissatisfied with the governance underperformance and freedom problems of such services. DWeb projects are technically mature to solve the governance issues, but cannot provide an easy-to-switch user experience on par with centralized services. For further funding, DWeb projects also require an app with great UX to showcase the power of the technical foundation. They will need, essentially, a Mastodon Effect. The success of Mastodon is primarily a UX success, it fits users’ expectations, looks aestetically pleasing, and just works, but the protocol foundation is somewhat lacking compared to modern P2P protocols, particularly in distributing power and authority. More conferences will happen on the topic of DWeb, not just the Decentralized Web Summit, which means the community around these projects will grow. In 2019 we might see one, two, or three very interesting end-user apps that fill the UX Gap and are able to start thriving communities. I am excited to be part of this future, and I hope it becomes a movement larger than any individual involved. I wish you a good start for 2019, too!"

    "summary": "<p>This was more exciting than a couple of previous WWDC, combined! The big announcements: Hooks, Suspense, Concurrent Mode and React Native’s new architecture.</p>\n<p>The conference was taking place in Las Vegas. It had only one track with keynotes, talks and lighting talks. There were plenty of long breaks for attendees to chat.</p>\n<p>All content was live streamed and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz5vTaEhvh7dOHEyd1efcaQ/videos\">video recordings</a> became available in just one day! (This is crazy, I’ve never seen the content from a conference appear online this fast).</p>\n<p>In this post I’ve collected some thoughts about the talks. My favorites: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpw9EHDh2bM\">React Today and Tomorrow</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew-UzGC8RqQ\">Playing With Polyhedra</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByBPyMBTzM0\">Concurrent Rendering in React</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcqRXTriUVI\">React Native’s New Architecture</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soAEB7ltQPk\">Let React speak your language</a>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://frantic.im/assets/react-conf-2018/og-image.jpg\"></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpw9EHDh2bM\">React Today and Tomorrow</a></h2>\n<p>In the keynote, Sophie talked about the state of React today and the most common problems: hard to reuse logic, wrapper hell and confusing classes.</p>\n<p>Dan presented a proposed solution: Hooks. Hooks is a mechanism that allows functional components access more advanced features of React, like state, context or side effects. Here’s a quick example:</p>\n<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>React</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>useState</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span><span>;</span>\n\n<span>function</span> <span>Counter</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>\n  <span>const</span> <span>[</span><span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>setValue</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>\n  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>\n    <span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>></span>\n      <span>&lt;</span><span>span</span><span>></span><span>Value</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>value</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/span</span><span>>\n</span>      <span>&lt;</span><span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span>=</span><span>{()</span> <span>=></span> <span>setValue</span><span>(</span><span>value</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)}</span><span>></span>\n        <span>Increment</span>\n      <span>&lt;</span><span>/button</span><span>>\n</span>    <span>&lt;</span><span>/div</span><span>>\n</span>  <span>)</span>\n<span>}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Note that it’s still RFC and React team is collecting feedback. There is some interesting discussion on <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/68\">the RFC pull request</a>.</p>\n<p>I’ve had a chance to play with the new API and personally I think it’s <strong>AWESOME</strong>. Hooks do require a little bit of a mindset shift, but they make code a lot easier to write and understand.</p>\n<p>Here’s a <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/threepointone/status/1056594421079261185\">clever illustration by @threepointone</a> that shows the difference between class-based components and functional components using hooks. Hooks make it easier to group and reuse behaviors that were spread out over multiple lifecycle methods.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://frantic.im/assets/react-conf-2018/class-vs-hooks.png\"></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpw9EHDh2bM\">90% cleaner React</a></h2>\n<p>Ryan Florence went into a more detailed demo of how hooks can be used to make code more readable and avoid common mistakes with effects. I would recommend watching it if you are still skeptical, otherwise it’s better to just get a feel of it in practice.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVSTKD13gos\">Cloud-Only Dev Environment</a></h2>\n<p>It’s interesting that a set of tools available online is more than enough to build a properly functioning app without setting up local development environment. Online IDEs + PaaS + static website hosting is enough to build fully-functional apps entirely from within your browser.</p>\n<p>In this talk Christina built a simple TODO game in under 30 minutes only using a browser on her Chromebook (leveraging Cloud9, Firebase and Zeit Now).</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e07uPWpvzI\">Declarative Animations</a></h2>\n<p>Animation is not a settled topic. We tend to swing between imperative and declarative. Both have pros and cons.</p>\n<p>What I liked most from this talk is that the framework Matt described allows plugins and middleware. For example, a <code>Modal</code> component could describe what needs to be animated (opacity &amp; zoom) and a middleware could customize the properties of the spring: make it playful or subtle. This way the same component could be used on a wedding website or a site for kids, and the animation would “feel” different in both cases to match the mood.</p>\n<p>I’m a little skeptical of animations that don’t take into account gestures. User input creates a lot of problems for animation libraries, and I’m not sure how the suggested framework can help.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSEUAi1dAdk\">GraphQL without GraphQL</a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“REST is like asking for a pizza with all 30 toppings and throwing away the ones you don’t need”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This walk was a little strange and fun and made audience chuckle a few times. The idea is to use GraphQL parser to extract queries from code, use them to send traditional REST request and then filter out fields that were not in the query.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew-UzGC8RqQ\">Playing With Polyhedra</a></h2>\n<p>This talk was an unexpected gem! Nat Alison shared her lifetime passion for geometric figures and how solids are like Pokemon. Definitely worth a watch!</p>\n<p>Check out the online <a href=\"https://polyhedra.tessera.li/\">Polyhedra Viewer</a></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jd6FBBK1paA\">Developing AR and VR Apps using React Native</a></h2>\n<p>I’ve learned so much about our perception while working at Oculus. This talk has a few cool demos that are designed to trick your mind.</p>\n<p>On the tech side, this is not about rendering every frame in JS. React helps build VR worlds by declaratively specifying what needs to be where, and all the heavy lifting is delegated to native frameworks.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6La7jSCnYyk\">React, JavaScript and WebAssembly To Port Legacy Native Apps</a></h2>\n<p>Florian built <a href=\"https://gdevelop-app.com/\">G-Develop</a> a decade ago. It’s a C++ app for making platformer games. In his talk he shows how he managed to convert the core of the app to JavaScript via asm.js and built a fresh UI on top of that with React.</p>\n<p>Electron nowadays gets a lot of critique from developer community for its resource usage. Here’s an example of the value web technologies on desktop provide: the new G-Develop can run in your browser, gets more contributions, has a much faster development and release pace.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE-0xb2f44g\">React For Social Change</a></h2>\n<p>Making tech easier to use is not only about developer efficiency. It means more people can leverage tech to do more things, that in turn can make lives of millions of people better. I’m super proud of React Native :)</p>\n<p>Rodrigo’s team built a React Native app for bus dispatchers and riders in Mexico City. It uses real-time data and ML to help everyone save time commuting.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByBPyMBTzM0\">Concurrent Rendering in React</a></h2>\n<p>This talk goes over two new features of React.</p>\n<p>Suspense allows “pausing” the render until the data is ready.</p>\n<p>Concurrent React is a new mode where React can interrupt rendering to serve high-priority update, or pre-render part of your app with a low priority.</p>\n<p>Both features help solve the problems many developers don’t know they have. Check out Thomas Aylott’s quote at the end of this post, I think it’s spot on.</p>\n<p>Oh, and don’t miss the part where Brian talks about the performance devtools. All the required pieces have finally came together and I’m excited about the new tooling.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCQgE4mTnjU\">Moving To Suspense</a></h2>\n<p>Ok, so now we have hooks, suspense and concurrent React. But we also have large React codebases that use none of these things yet.</p>\n<p>Jared gives a step-by-step overview of how a team could approach the new React features. The good news is that you don’t have to rewrite all your code, nor you need to make risky library upgrades.</p>\n<p>All new React features are opt-in and can be adopted incrementally.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gG8rtm-rq4\">SVG illustrations as React Components</a></h2>\n<p>SVGs are just XML-based documents containing vector image data. It’s easy to insert them directly into the DOM. In her (very first!) talk Elizabet shows how to use React to render SVG and the benefits of this approach.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/miukimiu/react-kawaii\">README of <code>react-kawaii</code></a> for a cool demo!</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqffsEHKMcM\">The Missing Abstraction of Charting</a></h2>\n<p>My first though when I saw the title of the talk: “Yet another charting library”. I was very wrong!</p>\n<p>Chris deeply researched the topic. Most libraries available for React provide high level API (e.g. <code>BarChart</code>) and sometimes access to very low level APIs (e.g. Canvas). All of them lack a mid-level abstraction. He took concepts from “The Grammar of Graphics” book and built a React-powered library that runs on web and mobile.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSwm1WZk7uA\">Elsa</a></h2>\n<p>Long time ago I’ve randomly discovered <a href=\"https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsDoctor\"><code>M-x doctor</code></a> and remember I was blown away. Unfortunately at the time I didn’t speak English much, but the Emacs Doctor did manage to surprise me a couple of times.</p>\n<p>Mental health gets very little attention at conferences. We are all humans and our operating system isn’t free of bugs.</p>\n<p>Damini shows how a bunch of cool technologies can be used to build a “debugger” with a conversational interface. Unfortunately the project isn’t available to play with yet.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXqyaslyXUw\">Block the Main Thread</a></h2>\n<p>There’s one space where React Native isn’t great yet: making smooth user interactions. The problem is not JavaScript (which is actually reasonably fast), it’s the async bridge between JS and Native.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are ways to make this better. James shows how one could dive into native side and build the required interactions using imperative native animations code. In the next talk Ram shows how the React Native team addresses the more generic issue.</p>\n<p>For the record, here’s a photo of original React Native architecture as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jordwalke\">@jordwalke</a> explained it to me in 2014.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“If the framework is async, making some parts of it synchronous would be easy. On the other hand, if the framework has all this assumptions of operation being synchronous, introducing async would be very hard”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><small>(see also: <a href=\"http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/\">red and blue functions</a>)</small></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://frantic.im/assets/react-conf-2018/react-arch.jpg\"></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcqRXTriUVI\">React Native’s New Architecture</a></h2>\n<p>Ram’s talk was really entertaining. It has a lot of visuals and animations that explain what’s going to happen to React Native internals in the near future.</p>\n<p>I’m super excited about the future of React Native! The team is extremely talented, <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2018/06/14/state-of-react-native-2018\">the roadmap</a> is very solid with many things already being tested in production.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soAEB7ltQPk\">Let React speak your language</a></h2>\n<p>Every single “JS localization” library I’ve seen in Open Source is terrible. It starts with something like this: define all strings your app is using in this giant XML/JSON/YAML/ini file.</p>\n<p>If you don’t see why this approach sucks, <strong>this talk will blow your mind</strong>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lingui.js.org/index.html\">LinguiJS</a>, the library Tomáš is working on, focuses on the right things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Developer experience. An easy-to-use API makes it trivial to mark things for translation. It’s also flexible enough to handle complex cases. It uses standard file formats that translation tools understand.</li>\n<li>User experience. The library has a way to inline all translations into the JS files, making close-to-zero impact on the bundle size.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Interestingly, at Facebook we use a similar library to translate our apps. I was hoping we could share it with the world, but unfortunately it’s too deeply integrated with the rest of build tooling.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DDdtt5zXPk&t=486s\">React for Designers with FramerX</a></h2>\n<p>Only half of the talk was about FramerX (which is a pretty cool piece of software). The other half was a little abstract and philosophical. If you don’t mind a little strange delivery format, there are some interesting thoughts.</p>\n<p>My favorite quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The tools we’ve mastered influence our perception of what problems exist. If we only have certain tools (hammer) we are incapable of perceiving certain problems (screw)”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYI9N0memLc\">Building A Diverse And Inclusive Community</a></h2>\n<p>It’s very hard. To make sure we build a community where everybody’s welcome, one needs to fight their built-in biases. For example, when organizing a meetup, it’s easy to not give enough thought to the food being ordered and miss people who have certain dietary restrictions.</p>\n<p>Btw, as also noted by Eyitayo, React Conf was <em>AWESOME</em> at this. Organizers went above and beyond to make sure everybody’s welcome.</p>"

    "keywords": null,
    "summary": "<p>I often get asked questions about using my software, particularly sway, on\nhypervisors like VirtualBox and VMWare, as well as for general advice on\nwhich hypervisor to choose. My answer is always the same: qemu. There’s no\nexcuse to use anything other than qemu, in my books. But I can admit that it\nmight be a bit obtuse to understand at first. qemu’s greatest strength is also\nits greatest weakness: it has so many options that it’s hard to know which ones\nyou need just to get started.</p>\n<p>qemu is the swiss army knife of virtualisation, much like ffmpeg is the swiss\narmy knife of multimedia (which comes as no surprise, given that both are written\nby Fabrice Bellard). I run a dozen permanent VMs with qemu, as well as all of\nthe ephemeral VMs used on <a href=\"https://meta.sr.ht\">builds.sr.ht</a>. Why is it better\nthan all of the other options? Well, in short: qemu is fast, portable, better\nsupported by guests, and has more features than Hollywood. There’s nothing other\nhypervisors can do that qemu can’t, and there’s plenty qemu can that they\ncannot.</p>\n<p>Studying the full breadth of qemu’s featureset is something you can do over\ntime. For now, let’s break down a simple Linux guest installation. We’ll start\nby downloading some install media (how about <a href=\"https://alpinelinux.org/\">Alpine\nLinux</a>, I like Alpine Linux) and preparing a virtual\nhard drive.</p>\n<div><div><pre><code>curl -O https://nl.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.8/releases/x86_64/alpine-standard-3.8.0-x86_64.iso\nqemu-img create -f qcow2 alpine.qcow2 16G\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>This makes a 16G virtual hard disk in a file named alpine.qcow2, the qcow2\nformat being a format which appears to be 16G to the guest (VM), but only\nactually writes to the host any sectors which were written to by the guest in\npractice. You can also expose this as a block device on your local system (or a\nremote system!) with qemu-nbd if you need to. Now let’s boot up a VM using our\ninstall media and virtual hard disk:</p>\n<div><div><pre><code>qemu-system-x86_64 \\\n    -enable-kvm \\\n    -m 2048 \\\n    -nic user,model=virtio \\\n    -drive file=alpine.qcow2,media=disk,if=virtio \\\n    -cdrom alpine-standard-3.8.0-x86_64.iso \\\n    -sdl\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>This is a lot to take in. Let’s break it down:</p>\n<p><strong>-enable-kvm</strong>: This enables use of the KVM (kernel virtual machine) subsystem\nto use hardware accelerated virtualisation on Linux hosts.</p>\n<p><strong>-m 2048</strong>: This specifies 2048M (2G) of RAM to provide to the guest.</p>\n<p><strong>-nic user,model=virtio</strong>: Adds a virtual <strong>n</strong>etwork <strong>i</strong>nterface\n<strong>c</strong>ontroller, using a virtual LAN emulated by qemu. This is the most\nstraightforward way to get internet in a guest, but there are other options (for\nexample, you will probably want to use <code>-nic tap</code> if you want the guest to do\nnetworking directly on the host NIC). <code>model=virtio</code> specifies a special\n<code>virtio</code> NIC model, which is used by the virtio kernel module in the guest to\nprovide faster networking.</p>\n<p><strong>-drive file=alpine.qcow2,media=disk,if=virtio</strong>: This attaches our virtual\ndisk to the guest. It’ll show up as <code>/dev/vda</code>. We specify <code>if=virtio</code> for the\nsame reason we did for <code>-nic</code>: it’s the fastest interface, but requires special\nguest support from the Linux virtio kernel module.</p>\n<p><strong>-cdrom alpine-standard-3.8.0-x86_64.iso</strong> connects a virtual CD drive to the\nguest and loads our install media into it.</p>\n<p><strong>-sdl</strong> finally specifies the graphical configuration. We’re using the SDL\nbackend, which is the simplest usable graphical backend. It attaches a display\nto the guest and shows it in an <a href=\"https://www.libsdl.org/\">SDL</a> window on the\nhost.</p>\n<p>When you run this command, the SDL window will appear and Alpine will boot! You\ncan complete the Alpine installation normally, using <code>setup-alpine</code> to install\nit to the attached disk. When you shut down Alpine, run qemu again without\n<code>-cdrom</code> to start the VM.</p>\n<p>That covers enough to get you off of VirtualBox or whatever other bad hypervisor\nyou’re using. What else is possible with qemu? Here’s a short list of common\nstuff you can look into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Running pretty much any guest operating system</li>\n<li>Software emulation of non-native architectures like ARM, PPC, RISC-V</li>\n<li>Using <code>-spice</code> instead of <code>-sdl</code> to enable remote access to the\ndisplay/keyboard/mouse</li>\n<li>Read-only disk images with guest writes stored in RAM (<code>snapshot=on</code>)</li>\n<li>Non-graphical boot with <code>-nographic</code> and <code>console=ttyS0</code> configured in your\nkernel command line</li>\n<li>Giving a genuine graphics card to your guest with KVM passthrough for high\nperformance gaming, OpenCL, etc</li>\n<li>Using <a href=\"https://virt-manager.org/\">virt-manager</a> or\n<a href=\"https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-boxes/stable/\">Boxes</a> if you want a GUI to\nhold your hand</li>\n<li>And much more…</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There’s really no excuse to be using any other hypervisor<sup><a href=\"https://drewdevault.com/2018/09/10/Getting-started-with-qemu.html#fn:1\">1</a></sup>. They’re all\ndogshit compared to qemu.</p>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Especially VirtualBox. If you use VirtualBox after reading this article you make poor life choices and are an embarrassment to us all. <a href=\"https://drewdevault.com/2018/09/10/Getting-started-with-qemu.html#fnref:1\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"

The batches move seamlessly from one subject to the next based on similarities in form, composition, color, and theme. This results visually in a colorful grid that slowly changes as the viewer scrolls through it. Images of houses being demolished transition into images of buildings on fire, to forest fires, to billowing smoke, to geysers, to bursting fire hydrants, to fire hoses, to spools of thread. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>3.</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2016/11/the-japanese-museum-of-rocks-that-look-like-faces/\">The Japanese Museum of Rocks That Look Like Faces.</a></p>\n<p>Does what it says on the tin.</p>\n<h3>4.</h3>\n<p>Here's a system <a href=\"https://zo7.github.io/blog/2016/09/25/generating-faces.html\">using artificial intelligence to generate human faces.</a></p>\n<p>Worth it for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the gifs seamlessly morphing between faces and emotions, exploring parameter space</li>\n<li>and, the best bit, the <em>illegal faces.</em> Search for the word <q>illegal</q> to see what the system does when it's asked to generate faces from inputs outside the regular range.

    "summary": "<p>Event-driven architectures are on the rise, in response to fast-moving data and constellations of inter-connected systems. In order to support this trend, last year we released <a href=\"https://www.heroku.com/kafka\">Apache Kafka on Heroku</a> - a gracefully integrated, fully managed, and carefully optimized element of Heroku's platform that is the culmination of years of experience of running many hundreds of Kafka clusters in production and contributing code to the Kafka ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Today, we are excited to announce additional plans and pricing in our Kafka offering in order to make Apache Kafka more accessible, and to better support development, testing, and low volume production needs. </p>\n\n<h2>\n<a name=\"apache-kafka-on-heroku-now-with-more-flexibility-and-speed\" href=\"https://blog.heroku.com/kafka-on-heroku-new-plans#apache-kafka-on-heroku-now-with-more-flexibility-and-speed\">Apache Kafka on Heroku: Now With More Flexibility and Speed</a>\n</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/\">Apache Kafka</a> is a powerful, distributed streaming platform, and the dominant open source solution in managing high scale event streams. Kafka enables you to easily design and implement architectures for many important use cases, such as elastic queuing, data pipelines &amp; analytics, and microservices coordination. Apache Kafka on Heroku removes the complexity and cost of running Kafka, making its valuable resources available to a broad range of developers and applications. </p>\n<p>The new addition to our managed Kafka plans, <strong>Basic,</strong> is based on a robust multi-tenant Kafka architecture. Multi-tenancy provides for much faster access to Kafka, with new resources being available in a matter of seconds, rather than minutes, and a much more accessible price point. This allows us to better serve application creators needing Kafka configurations that are more suitable for development or staging, or as production environments that don't require the full capacity of a dedicated cluster (as provided in our existing <strong>Standard</strong> and <strong>Extended</strong> plans).</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th><strong>Basic</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Standard</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Extended</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Cluster</strong></td>\n<td>Shared</td>\n<td>Dedicated</td>\n<td>Dedicated</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Event Stream Volume</strong></td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Massive</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ideal Use Case</strong></td>\n<td>Develop + Test, <br>Low-Scale Production</td>\n<td>Production</td>\n<td>Production</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Price ($/month)</strong></td>\n<td>$100+</td>\n<td>$1,000+</td>\n<td>$4,000+</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n<p>These new multi-tenant plans allow for rapid creation of Kafka add-ons, easy integration into Heroku applications, and the world-class monitoring and tooling you have come to expect from Heroku.</p>\n<iframe allowfullscreen src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/233739649\" width=\"640\" height=\"230\"></iframe>\n<h2>\n<a name=\"get-started-today\" href=\"https://blog.heroku.com/kafka-on-heroku-new-plans#get-started-today\">Get Started Today</a>\n</h2>\n<p>Using one of the new plans is as simple as provisioning an instance of the Kafka add-on and attaching it to a Heroku app:</p>\n<pre><code>heroku addons:create heroku-kafka:basic-0 -a sushi-app\n</code></pre>\n<p>We are excited to see what you build with Kafka!
