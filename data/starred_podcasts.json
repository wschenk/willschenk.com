    "notes": "Do you like cocoa? You are in good company: in South and Central America people have been enjoying the fruit of the cacao tree - the source of cocoa, chocolate and much else - for thousands of years. Ancient empires fought battles for the control of the best trees, cacao beans were used as currency, and being able to make a tasty cacao drink could even save your life. To trace the history of cacao in Latin America, Bridget Kendall is joined by archaeologist Cameron McNeil, chef and food historian Maricel Presilla and geneticist and cacao researcher Juan Carlos Motamayor. The reader is Joseph Balderama.<br /><br />(Photo: A cropped cocoa pod lies over dried cacao beans. Credit: Getty Images)"

Maybe.</p>\n<p>Back in the early 2010s, Sally Adee, then an editor at <em>New Scientist Magazine</em>, went to a DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) conference and heard about a way to speed up learning with something called trans-cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). A couple of years later, Sally found herself wielding an M4 assault rifle to pick off simulated enemy combatants with a battery wired to her temple. But that got then-producer Soren Wheeler thinking about this burgeoning world of electroceuticals, and if real, what limits will it reach.</p>\n<p>For this episode, first aired back in 2014, we brought in Michael Weisend, then a neuroscientist at Wright State Research Institute, to tell us how it works (Bonus: you get to hear Jad get his brain zapped). And sat down with Peter Reiner and Nick Fitz, then at the University of British Columbia, to help us think through the consequences of a world where anyone with 20 dollars and access to a circuit board and a soldering iron, can make their own brain zapper. And then checked-in again to hear about the unexpected after-effects a day of super-charged sniper training can have on one mild-mannered science journalist.</p>\n<p><strong>Episode credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Reported by Sally Adee and Soren Wheeler<br />Original music by Brian Carpenter&#39;s Ghost Train Orchestra</p>\n<p><em>Our newsletter comes out every Wednesday.

    "notes": "When the Kalevala was published in 1835, Finland had a distinct cultural and linguistic identity but it had always been part of either the Swedish or the Russian empire. Neither did Finland have much of a literary tradition, but as the 19th-century progressed the Kalevala took on a symbolic role as the representation of a Finnish identity that fed into the movement for Finnish independence. Rooted in the folk culture of the Karelia region, a travelling doctor shaped the song texts into a story in a way which is still being debated today.<br /><br />Joining Bridget Kendall to discuss how the Kalevala underscored the search for Finnish national identity are Dr Niina Hämäläinen, executive director of the Kalevala Society in Helsinki; Professor Tom DuBois from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the author of Finnish Folk Poetry and the Kalevala; and the award-winning British musician, playwright and storyteller, Nick Hennessey.  <br /><br /><br />Produced by Fiona Clampin for the BBC World Service.<br /><br /><br />[Image: The Defense of the Sampo, 1896.

The book is a record of hundreds of Goethe’s observations about the way colour affects our mood, as well as a long and heated polemic with Isaac Newton’s colour theory.  Goethe’s understanding of light and colour was scientifically flawed yet his book had a surprisingly strong influence on the fine and applied arts. To find out why, Bridget Kendall talks to art historian Alexandra Loske, colour writer Victoria Finlay and designer Odette Steele.<br />Alexandra Loske is an art historian who teaches at the University of Sussex, Curator at the Royal Pavilion and Brighton Museums and co-editor of the book Languages of Colour;<br />Victoria Finlay is a writer, former arts editor of the South China Morning Post and the author of Colour, Travels through the Paintbox and The Brilliant History of Color in Art;<br />Odette Steele is a Zambian textile designer recent and a graduate from the London College of Fashion at the University of the Arts, London.<br /><br />Photo: Goethe’s colour wheel, 1809.

    "notes": "<p><em><a href=\"http://spiralganglion.com/\">Ivan Reese</a> guest hosts.</em></p>\n<p>I&#39;ve been intimidated by <a href=\"http://jackrusher.com/\">Jack Rusher</a> from the first blush. I mean, he&#39;s wearing a high-collared fur coat and black sunglasses in his Twitter pic, and his bio includes &#34;Bell Labs Researcher&#34;. So when tasked with choosing a subject for my first interview, I immediately reached out to him, leaning in to my nervousness. His reply included the detail that he&#39;s &#34;generally hostile to the form&#34; of podcasting. Terrifying.</p>\n<p>When we talked, it was about Lisp — several flavours of Scheme and Racket, Common Lisp, Lisp machines, Black, Clojure, parens of all stripes. It was also about aesthetics, and graphic design, the relative ignorance of typical programming tools to the capability of the visual cortex, and how to better tap it. This podcast&#39;s streak of discussions about Coq, miniKanren, TLA&#43;, and Alloy continues, with the addition of QuickCheck and the like. Jack presents his work on a literate editor for Clojure called <a href=\"https://www.maria.cloud/\">Maria.cloud</a>, an environment that makes a number of unusual and interesting choices both in the design and implementation, reaching for an ideal blend of features that afford both instant beginner enthusiasm and unrestricted expert use. We pay our respects to the phenomenal red carpet that video games roll out to new players, inviting them in to the model and mechanics of the game with an apparent ease and apt ability that should be the envy of programming toolsmiths like us. The show ends with Jack sharing an excellent collection of plugs, ranging from academic papers by the relatively obscure Stéphane Conversy, to the aesthetically-lush programming tools pouring out of Hundredrabbits&#39;s Devine Lu Linvega.</p>\n<p>I am no longer terrified of Jack&#39;s persona. Rather, I am now humbled by his towering expertise and the wildly varied accomplishments of his career, and it was a thrill to get to tour them in this interview. Best quote of the show: &#34;A kind of grotesque capitulation to sameness.&#34; Damn, Jack!</p>\n<p><strong>Links</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jackrusher.com/\">Jack Rusher</a> is our esteemed guest.

We discuss the systems, the challenges as well as the modeling approaches.</p>\n<p></p>\n  <h2>Introduction</h2> 00:02:45<p> \n<a href=\"https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tpm/about-the-faculty/departments/multi-actor-systems/people/associate-professors/drir-i-igor-nikolic/\">Igor Nikolic TU Delft</a> | <a href=\"https://complexevo.org/\">Private website</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ComplexEvo\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tpm/about-the-faculty/departments/multi-actor-systems/\">TU Delft, Department Multi-Actor Systems</a> | <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociotechnical_system\">Sociotechnical system</a> | Complexity | <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity\">Complexity</a> | <a href=\"https://www.santafe.edu/\">Sante Fe Institute Home</a> | <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Institute\">Sante Fe Institute Wikipedia</a> | <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton\">Cell Automata</a> | <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_M._Epstein\">Joshua M.

    "notes": "Holochain has been a project simminging in the background of the blockchain space for several years now. The promise has been a panaceaic solution to the performance and scalability issues facing decentralised hosting platforms. It’s an oft heard claim, but, as founder Arthur Brock expounds in this interview, by giving up our insistence on global consensus in favor of discoverable and verifiable local state, a world of options is opened to us. <br />This kind of discussion follows from the Secure Scuttlebutt and Urbit episodes. It raises, and offers answers, to questions of data vs agent based ontologies. But most interesting of all, it forces us to reconsider why we wanted to use a blockchain in the first place.<br /><br /><br /><br />Arthur Brock from Denver Colorado<br />Interested in alternative currencies in 2001<br />Self organising companies are just a form of currency hacking<br />Discovered what a huge leverage point for change currency is<br />Change the business incentives and all business will reshape towards those incentives<br />The Future of Money, Bernard Leotard<br />2003 alternative currency became main gig<br />Metacurrency project 2004<br />Met Harris Brown<br />Currencies as more than money - symbol systems that we use to coordinate at scale<br />Out of metacurrency project came Ceptr 2006<br />Interact/transact with anyone else without intermediary<br />Required a reinvention of most of the communications stack.

Only relative state and time.<br />Holochain uses an Agent Centric approach rather than a Data Centric approach.<br />Each agent has their own chain for an application, only tracking the agents activity.<br />Genesis block of each chain includes a hash of the source code of the application.<br /><br /><br />Holochain.org<br />Holo.host<br />Artbrock.com<br />Ceptr.org<br />Metacurrency.org<br /><br />#webscale<br />#patriciatree"

We caught up to talk about his unique sailing philosophy, his movie ‘HOLD FAST’ &amp; his rise in the tech world.</p> <p>If you’ve followed the news even tangentially, you’ll have heard about encryption. Remember Edward Snowden? His revelations about the FBI’s mass collection of data from everyday Americans set off a wave of stories centered around personal privacy &amp; national security. Today’s guest is at the center of that debate - Moxie Marlinspike, almost single-handedly invented everyday encryption, and his code was recently implemented in WhatsApp and Facebook’s new ‘secret’ Messenger service. If you’re interested in this sort of thing at all, I highly recommend watching the documentary about Snowden called Citizen Four, and reading the recent WIRED Magazine profile on Moxie, which you can easily find on Google, or I’ll link it in the show notes.</p> <p>--</p> <p>This episode is sponsored by Forbes Horton Yachts.

    "description": "Tim Ferriss is a self-experimenter and bestselling author, best known for The 4-Hour Workweek, which has been translated into 40+ languages.  Newsweek calls him \"the world's best human guinea pig,\" and The New York Times calls him \"a cross between Jack Welch and a Buddhist monk.\"  In this show, he deconstructs world-class performers from eclectic areas (investing, chess, pro sports, etc.), digging deep to find the tools, tactics, and tricks that listeners can use.",

    "notes": "<p><strong>Paul Stamets</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulStamets\">&#64;PaulStamets</a>) is an intellectual and industry leader in the habitat, medicinal use, and production of fungi. Part of his mission is to deepen our understanding and respect for the organisms that literally exist under every footstep taken on this path of life. Paul is the author of <a href=\"https://rdcu.be/8vQo\">a new study in Nature&#39;s Scientific Reports</a>, which details how mushroom extracts—specifically extracts from woodland polypore mushrooms—can greatly reduce viruses that contribute to bee colony collapse.</p><p>Paul is the author of six books, including <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1580085792/offsitoftimfe-20\">Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1580081754/offsitoftimfe-20\">Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0898158397/offsitoftimfe-20\">Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World: An Identification Guide</a>, and he has discovered and named numerous species of psilocybin mushrooms. Paul is also the founder and owner of <a href=\"https://fungi.com/\">Fungi Perfecti</a>, makers of the <a href=\"https://hostdefense.com/\">Host Defense</a> mushroom supplement line, and it is something I&#39;ve been using since <a href=\"https://tim.blog/2018/10/01/samin-nosrat/\">Samin Nosrat</a> recommended it in my last book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1328994961/offsitoftimfe-20\">Tribe of Mentors</a>.</p><p>Paul has received numerous awards, including Invention Ambassador (2014-2015) for the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the National Mycologist Award (2014) from the North American Mycological Association (NAMA), and the Gordon &amp; Tina Wasson Award (2015) from the Mycological Society of America (MSA).</p><p>The implications, applications, and medicinal uses of what we discuss in this interview are truly mind-boggling, and we get into some of my favorite subjects, including psychedelics and other aspects of bending reality.

    "notes": "The Austrian satirical writer Karl Kraus used his forensic pen to expose the Hapsburg Empire and 20th century Vienna for its dishonesty and decay. He was the master of the punchy one liner, as well as being extremely prolific: his magazine Die Fackel ran to 922 editions, that&#39;s some 22 thousand pages, and Kraus wrote most of them.  <br />He was also full of contradictions: he could be both progressive and reactionary, sometimes profound and sometimes petty, and while he was born into affluence he remained concerned by other people&#39;s poverty. Many of his contradictions could be equally applied to the cultural world of Vienna itself in this period of turmoil and transition. And this makes Kraus - the journalist, poet, playwright, actor, lecturer and acerbic aphorist - a uniquely scathing and illuminating guide to this important historical epoch and the city at its heart. <br /><br />Rajan Datar talks about Kraus with Dr. Katharina Prager from the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for History and Society, Dr. Simon Ganahl from the Austrian Academy of Sciences, both in Vienna, and Germanist Dr. Ari Linden from the University of Kansas.<br /><br />Photo:  Karl Kraus (Imagno/Getty Images)"
