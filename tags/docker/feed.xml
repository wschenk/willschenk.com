We sure can! Lets walk through the process.
First make sure that docker is installed. This is handy if you are working on a remote server for example.
Bootstrap Then lets start building out the Dockerfile that we will use.
mkdir testapp cd testapp Create a Dockerfile.initial that has node:14 in it. Start up the container with Dockerfile.initial FROMnode:14WORKDIR/appCMD bash</description></item><item><title>Emacs Tramp tricks</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/tramp_tricks/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/tramp_tricks/</guid><description>Emacs is amazing. It&amp;rsquo;s a very different sort of thing than a code text editor like Vim or an IDE like VSCode. It&amp;rsquo;s a different way of thinking of how to interact with a computer, where you build up techniques on top of simple tricks that let you get amazing things done. Of course, part of the appeal/challenge is that you need to figure out how to make it work yourself.</description></item><item><title>Leveraging disposability for exploration</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/leveraging_disposability_for_exploration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/leveraging_disposability_for_exploration/</guid><description>I play around with a lot of technology to see what&amp;rsquo;s out there and keep myself current, especially trying to find simpler ways to do our work. One of the issues is that this can leave lots of stuff laying which can be messy. Here are some techniques I use to keep things under control.
There are two complementary principle&amp;rsquo;s that I focus on. One is reproducibility, and the other is disposibility.</description></item><item><title>Setting up an IPFS Node</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/setting_up_an_ipfs_node/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/setting_up_an_ipfs_node/</guid><description>IPFS nodes that run in the broswer communicate over websockets to the main network. Lets walk through how to setup a IPFS server that your browser code can connect to in addition to the public gateways. Strategy Wire everything up with docker-compose Create and configure an ipfs container Setup nginx with dummy certificate Replace that certificate with certbot Setup certbot to auto renew the certificates Requirements You will need: A server with a domain or subdomain to use certbot to get a certificate A working docker-compose install I&amp;#39;m using a prebuilt docker image on Digital Ocean but the key part is to get the domain name.</description></item><item><title>Installing guix on IntelNUC</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/installing_guix_on_nuc/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/installing_guix_on_nuc/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting into Guix and Emacs lately, going back to my Free Software roots. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing. Guix is a functional package manager that you can use on top of a linux distribution to have repeatable and rollbackable builds. Guix System is a distrubution that&amp;rsquo;s Guix all the way down.
I have an Intel NUC lying around that I wanted to use, so this is my effort to get a working Guix System installation on it.</description></item><item><title>Building a slimmer go Docker container</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/building_a_slimmer_go_docker_container/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/building_a_slimmer_go_docker_container/</guid><description>&lt;p>Go binaries are self contained, which means that they don&amp;rsquo;t need anything special installed in the environment to deploy them. When people make &lt;code>Dockerfiles&lt;/code> to build go projects, they often include the the golang compilers and build tools, which isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary for running the container. I&amp;rsquo;m going to use &lt;a href="https://github.com/somarat/healer">healer&lt;/a> Docker container that &amp;ldquo;Automatically heal docker containers that report themselves unhealthy&amp;rdquo; as an example of reducing the image size from 648MB to 17MB.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Setting up a chromebook for development</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/setting_up_chromebook/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/setting_up_chromebook/</guid><description>&lt;p>I just switch my pixelbook back to the stable channel, and this is what I did to get back to developing on it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
