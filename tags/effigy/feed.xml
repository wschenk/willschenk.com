I want it to return the hash of the stored object which I will use to load it again. First we will write a simple go service that will do everything in memory, and then we will build a nginx config that has the webserver stream it to disk, so we don&amp;#39;t have a lot of memory being used.</description></item><item><title>Effigy, a distributed social data layer</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/effigy_social_data_layer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/effigy_social_data_layer/</guid><description>I grew up in the world of BBSes, Usenet, and, to some extent, UUCP before that.

All you need is the computer that you already have with you.</description></item></channel></rss>
