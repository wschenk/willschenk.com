      <description>I grew up in the world of BBSes, Usenet and to some extent UUCP before that. This was fun, a world wide network all built up by volunteers sharing. Since we are all carrying supercomputers around now with massive idle storage and bandwidth, let&amp;#39;s think about how we can recreate some of that fun, independent data sharing with modern web technologies, specifically Websockets and WebRTC. All you need is the computers that you already have with you.</description>
