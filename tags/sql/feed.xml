Lets install it and see what we can figure out about the repo.

If you can&amp;#39;t figure out where it&amp;#39;s installed, check that you have GOPATH set correctly, and it will end up in $GOPATH/bin.</description></item><item><title>Dateslice: Writing rails extensions</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/dateslice-writing-rails-extensions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2014/dateslice-writing-rails-extensions/</guid><description>Ruby on Rails is a very modular framework since the merging with Merb in 2008.
