  <div class="about-bio">
    <p>I cofounded <a href="https://happyfuncorp.com">HappyFunCorp</a> in 2009 — a product engineering firm in Brooklyn that built apps for Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, and dozens of startups. We ran it for over a decade.</p>

    <p>In 2020 we moved the family from New York to <a href="https://cornwallct.org/">Cornwall, Connecticut</a>. My late wife Joy <a href="/fragments/2023/a_good_death/">passed away</a> in January 2022 from a brain hemorrhage. We sold HappyFunCorp later that year.</p>

    <p>I bought the old Cornwall Country Market space and reopened it as <a href="https://cornwallmarket.com">Cornwall Market</a> in January 2024 — a bakery, cafe, and neighborhood spot with pastries, chocolates, and sandwiches.</p>

    <p>I cofounded <a href="https://thefocus.ai">The Focus AI</a> in late 2024 with <a href="https://benschippers.com">Ben Schippers</a>. We help product-led companies ship working AI systems in weeks, not quarters. Our motto: distill the signal from the noise.</p>

    <p>My wife <a href="https://twitter.com/Kseniase_">Ksenia</a> and I live here with our four boys, one baby girl, and two dogs. I have a lumber mill and the kids love the tractor.</p>

    <p>I've been writing on this site since 2014. Before that, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010623085038/http://www.sublimeguile.com/">sublimeguile.com</a> going back to 2001.</p>
